Hi Sabrina,

I hope this message finds you well. I’m reaching out to discuss the budget allocation for the new sports therapy equipment we plan to integrate into our employee wellness program. As you know, enhancing the health and well-being of our team is a key component of our corporate objectives this quarter.

We are looking to purchase advanced physiotherapy tools that not only aid in recovery but also in preventative care. The total estimated cost is around $15,000. Given our current fiscal policies, I wanted to confirm if this would be feasible and aligned with our budgetary constraints.

Could you please advise on the procedures for getting this expenditure approved? Additionally, if you need any documentation or further information from my end, do let me know.

Thank you for your assistance!

Best,

Hi Alyssa,

Thanks for reaching out. I completely agree that investing in our team's health is crucial. Regarding the equipment budget, I think it's manageable given our current expenditure limits, but we'll need to ensure it aligns with the quarterly financial plans.

To proceed, please send over a detailed breakdown of the equipment costs and any vendor quotes you might have. Once I have those, I can prepare a formal request for the finance committee's review. Given that our monthly finance meeting is scheduled for October 12th, it would be ideal to have everything ready before then.

Feel free to reach out if you have any questions or need assistance with the documentation.

Best regards,
