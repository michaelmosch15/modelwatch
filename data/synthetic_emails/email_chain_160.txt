**Subject:** Collaboration Proposal for Rehabilitation Program

Hi Willie,

I hope this message finds you well. I am reaching out to discuss a potential collaboration between our departments that could align with Merck's commitment to social responsibility and innovation in rehabilitation services.

As you know, my focus has been on developing psychological support programs for individuals in the prison and probation systems. I believe there is an opportunity to integrate educational initiatives that your team specializes in, potentially creating a more holistic rehabilitation framework.

Could we schedule a time to discuss this further? I’m available for a call or meeting this Thursday or Friday morning. Please let me know your availability.

Looking forward to your thoughts.

Best regards,

Manuel Finley

Hi Manuel,

Great to hear from you! Your proposal sounds intriguing and aligns well with some of the museum-based educational outreach programs we’ve been developing. I believe combining our resources could indeed foster a more comprehensive rehabilitation approach.

I’ll be out of the office on Friday for a family commitment, but I’m available Thursday at 10 AM. We could meet in my office at the Museum Education Wing, Room 204, or have a virtual meeting if that’s more convenient for you.

Let me know what works best, and I’ll make the necessary arrangements.

Best,
