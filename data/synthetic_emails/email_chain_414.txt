**Subject:** Review of Insurance Risk Assessment for Q3  

Hi Andrea,

I hope this message finds you well. I am writing to discuss the upcoming insurance risk assessment for the third quarter. Given the changes in our production lines, particularly with the introduction of the new biosimilars, I want to ensure we are aligned on the potential tax implications that might arise from these operational shifts.

Could you please confirm if the preliminary risk assessment report will be ready for review by October 25th? I understand this is a tight timeline, but it would be beneficial to have a comprehensive overview before our next financial strategy meeting scheduled for November 1st.

Additionally, if there are any sections you believe need further tax analysis, please flag them so I can allocate resources accordingly. I am available for a call to discuss this further if that would be helpful. My direct line is 555-0192.

Thanks in advance for your collaboration on this.

Best regards,

Hi Perry,

Thanks for reaching out. I have been in touch with the team, and we are on track to deliver the preliminary risk assessment report by October 25th as requested. We are currently finalizing the sections on liability exposures related to the new biosimilars, and I'll ensure these are highlighted for your review.

I'll be sure to flag any areas we believe could benefit from additional tax insights. Would you be available for a quick call tomorrow at 11:00 AM to go over some initial findings? I think it would be beneficial to align on key focus areas ahead of the final report preparation.

Also, just a heads-up, I will be out of the office from October 30th to November 3rd for a family commitment, but I will ensure everything is in order before then.

Looking forward to our collaboration on this.

Best,
