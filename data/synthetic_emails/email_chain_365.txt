Hi Charles,

I hope this message finds you well. As you know, we're gearing up for the installation of the new attraction at the Merck BioPark. I wanted to touch base with you regarding the final engineering plans and the timeline for the setup.

The project is set to kick off on October 15, and I'd like to ensure that all site preparations align with our safety and operational standards. Could you confirm if your team has all the resources needed for the groundwork by then? If there are any materials or additional workforce requirements, please let me know by the end of this week.

Additionally, I will be out of the office on a business trip from October 9 to 11, so it would be great if we could have a quick meeting before I leave. Let me know your availability.

Looking forward to your response.

Best regards,

Ronald Wu

Hi Ronald,

Thanks for reaching out. We're on track with the engineering plans, and I'm confident that we can meet the October 15 start date. My team is currently finalizing the safety inspections, which should wrap up by this Friday.

Regarding resources, we're all set on materials, but I might need an extra pair of hands for the initial phase. I'll coordinate with HR to see if we can bring in a temporary contractor for that period.

I can definitely meet before your trip. How does 2 PM on Thursday sound? We can go over the final checks and any contingencies we should prepare for.

Let me know if that works for you.

Cheers,
