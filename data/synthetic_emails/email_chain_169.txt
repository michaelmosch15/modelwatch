Hi Alexis,

I hope this message finds you well. I'm reaching out to discuss the upcoming project that our team is spearheading in the new year. As you are likely aware, we are kicking off the Advanced Instrumentation Initiative in the Singapore R&D hub starting in February 2024. My team and I will be relocating there for an extended period.

To facilitate this, I need to ensure that my work visa is extended beyond its current expiration date of March 15, 2024. Could you guide me through the necessary documentation and process required to secure this extension? Additionally, if there are any recent changes to the policy or requirements that I should be aware of, please let me know.

Your assistance has always been invaluable, and I appreciate your guidance on this matter. Feel free to call me at (555) 013-4567 if you need further details or wish to discuss this over the phone.

Thank you in advance for your help!

Best regards,

Hi Susan,

Thank you for your email. It's great to hear about the Advanced Instrumentation Initiative; it sounds like an exciting project for you and the team.

Regarding your visa extension, you'll need to complete the Visa Extension Application Form and submit it along with a letter from HR confirming your assignment details in Singapore. I will send you the latest checklist of documents required by the end of the day. There have been some updates to the immigration policy effective October 1, 2023, particularly concerning processing times, so it’s good we’re addressing this well in advance.

I suggest setting up a brief meeting next week to go over everything, ensuring we cover all bases. Let me know what time works for you. I’m available Monday and Wednesday mornings.

If you have any immediate questions, feel free to reach out to me directly at (555) 789-0123.

Looking forward to assisting you with this!

Best,  
Alexis Craig
