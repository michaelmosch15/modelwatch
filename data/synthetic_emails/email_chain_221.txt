**Subject:** Collaboration on Pediatric Nutritional Guidelines  

Hi Caitlyn,

I hope this message finds you well. I am reaching out to discuss the ongoing project on developing comprehensive nutritional guidelines for pediatric patients, which was initiated in our last quarterly meeting.

Given your expertise as a child psychotherapist, I believe your insights into the psychological aspects of dietary habits and their impact on children's mental health would be invaluable. We aim to integrate a holistic approach, ensuring our guidelines are not only scientifically sound but also practically applicable for our patients and their caregivers.

Could we schedule a time to discuss this further? I'm available for a meeting next Wednesday afternoon, say around 2 PM. Please let me know if that works for you, or suggest an alternative time. Additionally, if there's any preliminary data or studies you'd like me to review beforehand, feel free to send them over.

Looking forward to our collaboration!

Best regards,

Hi Kelli,

Thank you for reaching out. I completely agree that integrating psychological insights into the nutritional guidelines is essential. It’s great to see Merck taking a comprehensive approach to pediatric care.

Next Wednesday at 2 PM works perfectly for me. Let's meet in my office on the 5th floor, Room 512. I'll prepare some recent studies on the correlation between nutrition and cognitive development that might be useful for our discussion.

Also, just a heads-up, I'll be on leave starting from the 20th for two weeks, so we should aim to make significant progress before then.

Looking forward to working together!

Best,
