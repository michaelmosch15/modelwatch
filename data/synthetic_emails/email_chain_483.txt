Subject: Collaboration Opportunity for Upcoming Exhibition

Hi Brent,

I hope this message finds you well. I wanted to reach out regarding a potential collaboration for the upcoming "Science in Nature" exhibition at the New Horizons Gallery scheduled for November 15th.

Given your expertise in curating engaging and informative exhibitions, I believe this could be a fantastic opportunity to showcase Merck's commitment to environmental sustainability and education. We’re particularly interested in highlighting how our recent initiatives in outdoor education align with the exhibition's theme.

Would you be available for a meeting next week to discuss this further? I'm available on Tuesday after 2 PM or Thursday morning, whichever suits your schedule best. Let me know what works for you.

Looking forward to your thoughts.

Best regards,

Hi Jaime,

Thanks for reaching out! The "Science in Nature" exhibition sounds like a wonderful project, and I agree that highlighting Merck's sustainability efforts would add significant value.

I appreciate the proposal and am eager to explore how we can integrate Merck's initiatives into the exhibition's narrative. Tuesday at 3 PM works perfectly for me, and we can meet at my office in the gallery. Please let me know if that suits you.

Additionally, could you bring along any material or visuals you have in mind? This would help us brainstorm how to best incorporate them into the exhibition layout.

Looking forward to our meeting.

Best,

Hi Brent,

Great, Tuesday at 3 PM in your office it is. I'll bring along some preliminary materials and visuals that our team has been working on, which should provide a good starting point for our discussion.

If you need anything from my end beforehand, feel free to reach out. Otherwise, I’ll see you on Tuesday.

Thanks again for considering this collaboration. I’m excited to see what we can create together!
