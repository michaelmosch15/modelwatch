Hi Andre,

I hope this message finds you well. I’m reaching out to discuss a potential collaboration on an upcoming research study focused on the integration of dance movement therapy in post-operative care for patients with chronic conditions. Given your expertise in biomedical engineering, particularly in designing patient-centric devices, your insights could be invaluable.

We are aiming to explore how wearable technology can enhance therapeutic outcomes by monitoring patient progress and adjusting therapeutic interventions in real-time. I believe that your team’s work on the recent "SmartSensor" project aligns perfectly with our objectives.

Would you have some time this week to discuss this further? I am available for a call on Thursday or Friday afternoon. Please let me know what works best for you.

Looking forward to your thoughts.

Best regards,

Hi Ebony,

Thank you for reaching out and considering our team for this exciting project. I’m very intrigued by the intersection of dance movement therapy and wearable tech. Your proposed study sounds like a great initiative to push the boundaries of patient-centric care.

I'm available for a call on Thursday afternoon. How does 2:00 PM sound? We can use the opportunity to discuss how our SmartSensor technology can be adapted for therapeutic tracking and data collection purposes.

Also, just a quick note, I will be out of the office next week for a conference in Chicago, so it would be great to get the ball rolling before then.

Looking forward to our discussion.
