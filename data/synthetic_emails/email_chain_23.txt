Hi Monica,

I hope this message finds you well. I’m reaching out to discuss a potential collaboration on enhancing our Employee Wellness Program. As you know, Merck places a high value on the well-being of its employees, and we’re exploring ways to integrate more holistic approaches into our existing framework.

Given your expertise in project management and engineering, I believe you could provide invaluable insights into the structural and logistical aspects of implementing new wellness initiatives. Specifically, I’m interested in your thoughts on creating dedicated wellness spaces within our facilities and how we might efficiently use our current resources.

Could we schedule a time to discuss this further? I’m available for a meeting next Tuesday, October 17th, after 2 PM. Let me know if this works for you or if there’s a better time.

Looking forward to your thoughts!

Best,

Hi Vanessa,

Thanks for reaching out! I’m definitely interested in contributing to the Employee Wellness Program. Creating spaces that promote mental and physical health aligns perfectly with our goals to support a healthy work-life balance.

Next Tuesday after 2 PM works for me. Let's meet in Conference Room B on the second floor. I’ll bring some preliminary sketches and ideas about how we might utilize our existing office spaces efficiently. Also, maybe we can brainstorm about incorporating sustainable materials into the design? I’ve done some research on low-impact options that might be beneficial.

Looking forward to our discussion. See you on the 17th!
