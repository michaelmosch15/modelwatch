Hi Cristian,

I hope this message finds you well. I'm reaching out to discuss an exciting opportunity to enhance our visitor center with an engaging botanical display that aligns with Merck's mission of innovation and sustainability.

Given your expertise in amenity horticulture, I believe your insights would be invaluable in curating a selection of medicinal plants that not only beautify the space but also educate visitors on the historical and contemporary uses of these plants in pharmaceuticals. This initiative aligns with our goal to enrich visitor experiences and could serve as an interactive learning tool for various educational groups.

Could we schedule a meeting to brainstorm ideas and discuss potential plant selections? I'm available this Thursday or Friday afternoon, whichever works best for you. Please let me know your availability.

Looking forward to collaborating with you on this project.

Best regards,

Hi Sharon,

Thank you for reaching out—this sounds like a fantastic initiative! I agree that incorporating a botanical display could significantly enhance the educational aspect of our visitor center. It's a great way to demonstrate the link between nature and our innovative pharmaceutical solutions.

I’m available this Thursday at 3 PM. Does that work for you? We can meet in my office, Room 214 in Building 5. I'll prepare some initial ideas for plant species that have historical pharmaceutical relevance and are suitable for our environment.

Please feel free to bring any educational materials or concepts you think might integrate well with the horticultural aspect. I'm excited about the potential impact this could have on our visitors.

Looking forward to our meeting.

Best,
