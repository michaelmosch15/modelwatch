Hi Jason,

Thanks for sending over the first draft of the script for the new video series. I've gone through it, and overall, it aligns well with our goals to highlight Merck's latest innovations in a compelling way. Great work!

However, I have a few suggestions for refining the copy to ensure it resonates with our target audience:

1. **Technical Jargon:** In the segment about the CRISPR technology, we might need to simplify some of the terms. While it's important to convey our expertise, we should aim for accessibility to a broader audience.

2. **Case Studies:** Are there any specific case studies or success stories we can weave into the narrative? Real-world examples would enhance credibility and engagement.

3. **Call to Action:** Let’s incorporate a clear call to action at the end of the video. Perhaps directing them to our website for more detailed white papers or to sign up for our newsletter.

Also, just a heads up, I'll be out of the office next Thursday and Friday for a conference, but I'll be available via email if any urgent questions come up.

Feel free to give me a call if you'd like to discuss these points in detail. My direct line is 555-0192.

Looking forward to the next steps.

Best,  
Martin

Hi Martin,

I hope this message finds you well. I'm attaching the first draft of the script for our upcoming video series on pharmaceutical innovations at Merck. The goal is to highlight some of our groundbreaking work in areas like CRISPR and vaccine development, emphasizing how these innovations are transforming patient care.

Please review the draft and let me know your thoughts. I'm particularly interested in your feedback on the tone and the technical content, given your expertise in crafting compelling narratives.

Once we finalize the script, I’ll coordinate with the production team to schedule the shoot. We're aiming to have everything wrapped up before the end of the quarter.

Let me know if there’s a time this week to discuss any revisions or additional elements you think we should include.

Thanks,
