Subject: Translation Required for Upcoming Construction Project  

Hi Joe,

I hope this message finds you well. We're gearing up for the expansion of our R&D facility in Rahway, NJ, and I need your expertise on a set of architectural guidelines that have come in from our partners in Germany. It's crucial that we have an accurate translation to ensure compliance with both local and international standards.

Could you prioritize this task? The documents are attached. I’ll need the translated guidelines by October 20th to review before the project kickoff meeting on October 25th.

Feel free to reach me at (555) 123-4567 if you have any questions or need further details. Also, let me know if you're available for a quick call to discuss any potential challenges you foresee.

Thanks in advance for your help!

Best,  
Marvin Briggs

Hi Marvin,

Thanks for reaching out. I've received the documents and will start working on them right away. I’ll make sure to have the translation ready by October 20th as requested.

Could we schedule a brief call tomorrow afternoon to go over any specific terminologies or sections that might require special attention? I want to ensure that everything aligns perfectly with the project needs. I’m available anytime between 2 PM and 4 PM—let me know what works for you.

By the way, I’ll be out of the office next week for a conference in Berlin, but I’ll make sure this is wrapped up before then.

Looking forward to your confirmation.

Best regards,
