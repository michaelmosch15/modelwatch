Hi Valerie,

I hope this message finds you well. As we gear up for the upcoming site survey for our new R&D facility, I wanted to touch base with you to ensure we're aligned on the financial projections and timelines.

Given the strategic importance of this project, it's critical that we accurately assess all potential variables. As you know, the location's proximity to our existing supply chain network can significantly impact our operational costs and, ultimately, our investment decisions.

Could you please share the preliminary site evaluations by the end of this week? I need to analyze the data before our review meeting with the executive board on November 3rd. If you require any additional financial data or projections to assist in your assessments, don't hesitate to reach out.

Additionally, if you're available, perhaps we could have a quick call tomorrow afternoon? Say around 3 PM? I want to make sure we’re on the same page before we present to the stakeholders.

Looking forward to your insights.

Best regards,

Hi Karl,

Thanks for reaching out. Yes, the new R&D facility is indeed an exciting development for us, and I completely agree that we need to get the numbers right from the start.

I’m currently finalizing the preliminary site evaluations and will have them ready for you by Friday. I’ll ensure the report includes a detailed analysis of logistical advantages and any potential zoning restrictions that could affect our timeline.

A call tomorrow at 3 PM works perfectly. I’ll be in the office and will have all the relevant documentation ready for our discussion. Please let me know if there's anything specific you’d like me to prepare ahead of our call.

Looking forward to working closely with you on this. Talk soon!

Best,
