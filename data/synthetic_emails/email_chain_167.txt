Hi Peter,

I hope this email finds you well. I'm writing to update you on the progress of the system integration for the new trading platform that will manage our pharmaceutical bonds. As you know, this is a key part of our strategy to streamline operations by Q1 2024.

We encountered a few issues with the API data feed from the external vendor, which caused some delay in the testing phase. However, I'm pleased to inform you that these have been resolved as of last Friday, and the system is now running smoothly in our Staging environment.

Could you please let me know your availability this week for a brief call to discuss any specific requirements your team might have? We want to ensure the platform aligns perfectly with your trading strategies. My schedule is pretty flexible, except for Wednesday morning, as I'll be attending a project management workshop.

Looking forward to your feedback.

Best,

Hi Brad,

Thanks for the update and for resolving the issues with the API. It's great to hear that the system is back on track. This integration is crucial for optimizing our bond trading operations, especially considering the upcoming launch of our new pharmaceutical product line next quarter.

I can do a call on Thursday after 2 PM. Please let me know if that works for you. If there are any documents or additional data points you need from our end before the call, feel free to reach out.

On a side note, I’ll be on leave the last week of October, so if we can finalize most of the integration details before then, it would be ideal.

Thanks again for your hard work on this.

Best,
