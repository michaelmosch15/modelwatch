Hi Sharon,

I hope this message finds you well. I’m reaching out to discuss the upcoming launch of our new oncology product, which is scheduled for November 15th. As part of the Economic Analysis Team, I’ve been tasked with evaluating the potential market impact and overall economic benefits this launch could have.

We’re putting together a presentation for the stakeholders’ meeting on October 25th, and it would be incredibly beneficial to include some high-quality visuals and footage of our recent clinical trials. Given your expertise with video equipment and your ability to capture impactful footage, I was hoping you could assist us in creating a compelling video segment.

Could we schedule a time to discuss this further? I’m based in the Princeton office but can be flexible with a virtual meeting if that works better for you. Let me know your availability this week or early next.

Thanks,

Hi Philip,

Thanks for reaching out! I’m excited to hear about the new product launch, and I’d love to help out with the video segment for your presentation. Capturing the essence of our clinical trials is crucial, and I’m glad to be a part of this initiative.

I’m available for a virtual meeting this Thursday after 2 PM or anytime Friday morning. Let me know what works best for you. I’ll make sure to have some ideas ready and maybe we can discuss what specific angles and footage you’re envisioning. I’m currently stationed at the Rahway office, but I’m scheduled to be in Princeton next week, so we can also coordinate in person if needed.

Looking forward to collaborating on this!

Best,

Hi Sharon,

Great to hear back from you so quickly! Let’s plan for a virtual meeting this Thursday at 3 PM. I’ll send over a calendar invite with a Teams link. We can discuss the project in detail then, and I’ll share some preliminary data that might help guide the visuals.

Thanks again for your willingness to help. This will definitely enhance our presentation and provide a comprehensive view to the stakeholders.

Talk soon,  
Philip
