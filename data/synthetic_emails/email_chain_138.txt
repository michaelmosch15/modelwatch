Hi Marisa,

I hope this message finds you well. I’m reaching out to request your assistance with translating some financial documents that are crucial for our Q4 review. These documents need to be translated from English to Spanish, as we have several stakeholders in our Latin American markets who will need to review them.

The documents include the Q4 budget forecast and the year-end financial summary. It's important that we maintain accuracy and financial jargon throughout the translation to ensure our stakeholders receive a clear and precise understanding.

Could you please confirm your availability to take on this task? Ideally, we would need the translations completed by October 20th to allow ample time for review before the meeting with the regional managers on October 25th.

Please let me know if you require any additional resources or have any questions. I'm available to discuss this further if needed. You can reach me at my direct line, (555) 456-7890.

Looking forward to your response.

Best regards,

Mackenzie Middleton
