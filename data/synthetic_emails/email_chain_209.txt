**Subject:** Coordination for Upcoming Pharmaceutical Art Exhibit

Hi Tom,

I hope this message finds you well. As part of our initiative to merge artistic expression with pharmaceutical innovation, I wanted to touch base regarding the upcoming exhibit at the Merck Innovation Gallery.

We’re aiming to feature pieces that capture the essence of our recent breakthroughs in oncology and immunology. Given your expertise and network in the art world, I believe you’d be instrumental in curating artworks that resonate with both scientific and artistic communities.

Could we schedule a meeting next week to discuss potential collaborations? I’m available on Tuesday and Thursday from 10 AM to 1 PM at our Rahway office. Let me know what works for you.

Looking forward to your insights!

Best regards,

Hi Gabriella,

Thank you for reaching out. The idea of integrating art with our pharmaceutical innovations is both exciting and forward-thinking. I’d be thrilled to assist in curating this exhibit.

Tuesday at 11 AM works perfectly for me. I’ll meet you at the Rahway office. In the meantime, I’ll start reaching out to artists who have previously worked on medical-themed projects. I believe this will add a unique dimension to our exhibit.

Please let me know if there are specific themes or styles you have in mind, so I can align the selection accordingly.

Looking forward to our collaboration!

Best,

Feel free to bring any initial ideas or portfolios to the meeting. I’m sure we’ll come up with something exceptional together.

Thanks again, and see you soon!
