Hi Lawrence,

I hope this message finds you well. We're in the process of finalizing the designs for the new blown glass installations intended for the lobby area in our Rahway office. Given the unique properties of the materials and the fact that these installations will be in a high-traffic area, I want to ensure we meet all necessary health and safety standards.

Could you please review the attached design specifications and let me know if you foresee any potential compliance issues? Your insights would be invaluable, particularly in relation to the structural integrity and placement concerning employee safety.

I’m aiming to have everything ready for installation by November 15th, so a timely review would be appreciated. If needed, I am available for a walkthrough at your convenience.

Thank you for your assistance.

Best regards,

Hi Tony,

Thanks for reaching out. I’ve had a chance to look over the design specifications you sent. Overall, the plans are impressive and should add a great aesthetic to the office. However, there are a couple of points we need to address:

1. **Anchoring and Support**: We need to ensure that the installations are securely anchored. Given their size, I recommend a detailed structural analysis to prevent any potential mishaps.

2. **Material Safety**: Blown glass can pose significant risks if broken. We should consider protective measures or alternative materials for areas within reach of high foot traffic.

I’m available for a walkthrough next Tuesday, October 17th, anytime between 10 AM - 2 PM. Let me know what works for you, and we can discuss further.

Looking forward to working together to ensure everything is up to the highest safety standards.

Best,
