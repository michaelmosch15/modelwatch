**Subject:** Collaboration on Energy Efficiency for Clinical Trials  

Hi Mercedes,

I hope this email finds you well. I'm reaching out to discuss the potential collaboration between our departments on enhancing energy efficiency in our clinical trial sites. As you know, with Merck's commitment to sustainability, it's crucial that we explore every opportunity to reduce our carbon footprint.

I've been reviewing some recent studies and believe that integrating more energy-efficient practices into our clinical operations could not only lower our environmental impact but also reduce costs in the long run. Your expertise in energy engineering would be invaluable in identifying key areas for improvement.

Could we schedule a meeting next week to brainstorm some ideas? I'm available Monday and Wednesday afternoons. Let me know what works for you.

Looking forward to your insights.

Best,

Hi Patricia,

Thank you for reaching out! I completely agree that focusing on energy efficiency is a great step forward for our clinical trial sites. Not only does this align with Merck's sustainability goals, but it also sets a benchmark for the industry.

Let's definitely set up a time to discuss this further. Monday afternoon works perfectly for me. How about we meet at 2 PM in the conference room on the 5th floor? I can bring some preliminary data on energy usage across our sites that might help guide our discussion.

Looking forward to collaborating with you on this initiative. Also, just a heads-up, I'll be out of the office from the 15th to the 22nd for some personal time, so it would be great to get the ball rolling before then.

Best regards,
