Hi Zachary,

I hope this message finds you well. I’m reaching out to discuss an exciting initiative we’re launching at Merck. As part of our commitment to raising awareness about hematological health, we’re planning a specialized campaign during Hematology Awareness Month in November.

We’re looking to design a series of awareness bracelets that not only serve as a symbol of support but also feature elements that reflect the science and importance behind hematology. Given your expertise, I’d appreciate your insights on what themes or elements would be most impactful to incorporate. 

Could we schedule a meeting next week to brainstorm ideas? I’m available Tuesday and Thursday afternoon. Let me know if either of those works for you or suggest another time that fits your schedule.

Looking forward to your thoughts!

Best regards,

Hi Ariel,

Thank you for reaching out and involving me in this meaningful project. The idea of designing awareness bracelets is fantastic and can certainly help in spreading the message about the importance of hematological health.

For the design, it might be impactful to incorporate elements that symbolize blood cells or the circulatory system, perhaps using colors that represent different blood components. I can provide some detailed insights and scientific references that could inspire your design.

Regarding the meeting, Thursday afternoon works perfectly for me. How about 2 PM? We can meet in my office, Room 17A on the 5th floor, or I’m happy to come to your workspace if that’s more convenient.

Looking forward to collaborating on this!

Best,
