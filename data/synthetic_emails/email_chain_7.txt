Hi Luke,

I hope this message finds you well. I’m reaching out to discuss the ongoing integration of our software tools for the new analytical data processing system. As you know, we’re aiming to streamline the data analysis for the recent batch of API synthesis results.

Could you provide an update on the progress of the software development? Specifically, I’d like to know if the customization for the chromatography data interpretation module is on track for our end-of-month deadline. The team is eager to begin testing these enhancements as soon as possible.

Additionally, I wanted to mention that I’ll be out of the office from October 23rd to 27th for a conference, so it would be ideal to have a preliminary review before then. Please let me know when you’re available to catch up this week. I’m based in the South Campus office, Room 312, if you’d like to meet in person.

Thanks,  
Maria

Hi Maria,

Thanks for reaching out. I’ve been coordinating with our team to ensure the chromatography data interpretation module is on track. We’ve encountered some minor issues with the data parsing protocols, but I anticipate having these resolved by the end of this week.

I’ll schedule a meeting for us to review the progress before your conference. How does Thursday at 2 PM sound? We can meet at your office, Room 312, to go over the updates. In the meantime, I’ll also send over the latest software build for your preliminary feedback.

Let me know if there’s anything else you need in the meantime. Looking forward to our meeting.

Best,  
Luke

Thursday at 2 PM works perfectly. I appreciate the prompt response and your efforts to keep us on schedule. I’ll review the software build as soon as I receive it and provide any feedback.

Thanks again for your support on this project. Looking forward to our meeting.

Best regards,
