Hi Chris,

I hope this email finds you well. I’m reaching out to discuss the upcoming rollout of the dental care initiative that we will be piloting in our international branches. Given your expertise in diplomatic services, your insights will be invaluable as we navigate the logistical and regulatory aspects across different regions.

Could we schedule a meeting next week to align on our strategies and ensure compliance with local healthcare regulations? I am available on Wednesday and Thursday afternoon. Let me know what works best for you.

Additionally, I wanted to remind you that I will be out of the office from October 25th to November 1st for a conference, so I’d like to ensure we have everything in place before then.

Looking forward to your response.

Best regards,

Hi Suzanne,

Thanks for reaching out. I agree, aligning our strategies before your leave is crucial. Let’s aim for a meeting on Thursday afternoon at 2 PM. We can use the time to go over the regulatory frameworks and establish a communication channel with our regional teams to facilitate smooth implementation.

I’ll prepare a draft agenda and send it your way by tomorrow. Also, if there are specific regulatory concerns or cultural considerations you’ve encountered in past initiatives, feel free to forward them, and I’ll ensure they’re addressed.

Looking forward to collaborating on this exciting project.

Best,

Hi Chris,

Thursday at 2 PM works perfectly. I’ll gather some notes on past initiatives and share them with you by the end of the day. It’s great to know we’re on the same page in terms of strategy and execution.

Thanks for taking the lead on the agenda. I’m confident that with your experience, we’ll have a comprehensive plan in place.

See you on Thursday.

Best,  
Suzanne
