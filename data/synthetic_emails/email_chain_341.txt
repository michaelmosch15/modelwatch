Hi Bonnie,

I hope this message finds you well. I wanted to follow up on the recent plans we discussed regarding the new sports facility at the Kenilworth campus. As you know, our goal is to create a state-of-the-art facility that not only supports employee wellness but also aligns with our sustainability initiatives.

We've made significant progress since our last meeting. The preliminary designs are completed, and we're on track to begin phase one of the construction by the end of November. I wanted to ensure that these designs meet the requirements you outlined for integrating sports science technology.

Could we schedule a meeting later this week to review the designs and discuss any adjustments before final approval? I'm available Thursday and Friday afternoon. Let me know what works best for you.

Looking forward to your feedback.

Best regards,

Hi Marc,

Thanks for the update. It's great to hear that we're making progress on the facility. Ensuring that the designs incorporate advanced sports science technology is crucial, as we want this facility to be a benchmark for our other locations.

Thursday afternoon works perfectly for me. Let's plan to meet at 3 PM in Conference Room B on the second floor. I'll bring along the specs for the technology integrations, and we can go over them together.

Also, just a heads up, I'll be out of office starting next Wednesday for a conference in Chicago, so it would be ideal to finalize the designs before then.

Looking forward to our meeting.

Best,
