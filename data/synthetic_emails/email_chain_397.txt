**Subject:** Inquiry About Collaboration for New Museum Exhibit

Hi Omar,

I hope this message finds you well. I'm reaching out to discuss a potential collaboration opportunity with the Merck Innovation Gallery. As the Industrial Buyer here, I've been tasked with sourcing unique exhibits that can showcase the evolution of pharmaceutical technology and its societal impact.

Given your expertise and impressive track record at the Merck Museum, I believe we could work together to create a compelling exhibit that aligns with our upcoming "Pharmaceuticals: Past, Present, Future" theme, set to launch in Q2 2024. We are particularly interested in highlighting groundbreaking projects, including our recent advancements in mRNA technology and sustainable manufacturing practices.

Could we schedule a time next week to discuss this further? I'm available for a call on Tuesday and Thursday between 10 AM and 2 PM. Please let me know what works best for you.

Looking forward to your thoughts.

Best regards,

Hi Perry,

Thank you for reaching out. I'm excited about the possibility of collaborating with the Innovation Gallery on the upcoming exhibit. The theme sounds fascinating, and I agree that highlighting the evolution of pharmaceutical technology is both timely and essential.

I have a few ideas about how we could incorporate interactive elements and digital installations to engage visitors more effectively. It would be great to brainstorm these with you. I’m available for a call next Thursday at 11 AM. Let me know if that works for you or if there's another time that suits you better.

Also, please note that I will be on leave from November 20 to December 1, so I’d like to finalize any initial plans before then.

Looking forward to our discussion.

Best,
