**Subject:** Collaboration on New Wellness Initiative  

Hi Cristian,

I hope this email finds you well. I am reaching out to discuss an exciting new initiative we are developing to enhance employee wellness at our facilities. Given your expertise as an Architectural Technologist, I believe your input would be invaluable in designing spaces that facilitate physical activity and mental well-being.

We aim to create environments that encourage movement and relaxation, fostering a healthier, more productive workforce. Specifically, we are considering integrating more dynamic spaces like indoor walking tracks and meditation zones within our existing office layouts.

Could we schedule a time to discuss this project further? I am available this Thursday or Friday afternoon. Please let me know your availability.

Looking forward to your thoughts and collaboration.

Best regards,

Hi Kylie,

Thank you for reaching out—this sounds like a fantastic initiative, and I would be thrilled to contribute. Creating more dynamic and wellness-focused environments is right in line with some of the sustainable design principles we're looking to incorporate at Merck.

I am available this Thursday after 3 PM. Would that work for you? We can meet in my office on the third floor, room 312. Alternatively, we could arrange a virtual meeting if that’s more convenient.

Additionally, I’ll be on leave starting next Wednesday for a week, so if we could settle on some initial plans before then, that would be ideal.

Looking forward to our collaboration.

Best,
