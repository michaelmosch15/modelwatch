Hi Bruce,

I hope this message finds you well. I’m reaching out to discuss the upcoming Health Awareness Campaign we’re planning to roll out next quarter. As you know, our team is focusing on increasing awareness around adult vaccination schedules, which is particularly timely given the recent updates to CDC guidelines.

Given your expertise in media planning, I’d love to get your insights on the best channels to effectively reach our target demographic. We’re looking at a multi-platform approach, but I’d appreciate your recommendations on optimizing our budget for maximum impact.

Could we schedule a meeting next week to brainstorm ideas? I’m available on Wednesday and Thursday mornings. Let me know what works for you.

Thanks in advance for your help!

Best,

Hi Samantha,

Great to hear from you, and thanks for looping me in on this important initiative. The focus on adult vaccination is crucial, and I’m excited to contribute to the campaign’s success.

I agree that a multi-platform strategy is the way to go. We should definitely consider a mix of digital and traditional media, including targeted social media ads and possibly some local radio spots to reach a broader audience. I’ve been reviewing some data from our recent campaigns, and I think we can leverage some of those insights here.

Wednesday morning works perfectly for me. Let’s meet at 10 AM in Conference Room B on the 5th floor. Please let me know if you need any specific materials or data prepared for our meeting.

Looking forward to collaborating!

Best,
