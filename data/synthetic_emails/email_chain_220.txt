Hi Ernest,

I hope this email finds you well. I am reaching out to discuss the upcoming Public Safety and Health Research Initiative that Merck is collaborating on with various governmental bodies. Given your expertise and the vital role law enforcement plays in public health, I believe your insights would be invaluable to our project.

We are aiming to assess the impact of pharmaceutical interventions in reducing drug-related offenses and enhancing community safety. Your experience on the ground would provide critical perspectives that can shape our research objectives and methodologies.

Could we schedule a time to discuss this further? I am available for a call next Wednesday, October 25th, anytime between 10:00 AM and 3:00 PM. Please let me know what works for you.

Looking forward to your thoughts.

Best regards,
