Subject: Collaboration on Upcoming Conference Catering  

Hi Clarence,

I hope this message finds you well. I am reaching out to discuss the upcoming Merck Global Health Summit scheduled for November 15 at our Rahway, NJ campus. As you know, this is a significant event for us, and we anticipate around 300 attendees, including international partners and key stakeholders in the pharmaceutical industry.

Given your expertise in managing fast-paced, high-quality service, I believe you would be the perfect fit to handle the catering needs for this event. We aim to provide a diverse menu that accommodates various dietary restrictions and preferences—something that will be both impressive and inclusive.

Could we schedule a time to discuss this further? I am available for a call this Thursday after 2 PM or Friday morning. Let me know what works best for you. You can reach me directly at (973) 555-0147.

Looking forward to your thoughts.

Best regards,

Hi Marisa,

Thank you for considering me for this opportunity. I am excited about the chance to contribute to the Merck Global Health Summit.

I can certainly coordinate a menu that will cater to a wide range of dietary needs. We can include options for vegetarian, vegan, gluten-free, and other specific requirements. Additionally, we can emphasize local and sustainable ingredients, which is something I know Merck values highly.

Thursday at 2:30 PM works perfectly for me. I'll prepare some preliminary menu ideas and a draft timeline for the catering setup and service. Please let me know if there's anything specific you would like me to address during our call.

Looking forward to working together on this project.

Best,
