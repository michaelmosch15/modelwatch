Hi Mike,

I hope this message finds you well. I wanted to follow up on the points we discussed during yesterday's quarterly outlook meeting, specifically regarding the projected trends in API futures for Q4. The recent data from our R&D pipeline suggests some promising developments, and I believe we should reconsider our position on certain contracts.

Could you take a look at the latest analytics report I forwarded to you last week? I think it warrants a closer look before we finalize the strategy. Also, let's sync up to discuss potential adjustments to our hedging approach given the new market data.

Are you available for a call this Thursday around 2 PM? If that doesn't work, let me know what time suits you better. I'm aiming to have a solid plan in place before I head out on my leave starting next Wednesday.

Thanks,  
Megan

Hi Megan,

Thanks for reaching out. I reviewed the analytics report, and I agree that our current stance may need some fine-tuning. The emerging data from our R&D side is quite encouraging, especially with the new biosimilar launches that could impact raw material costs.

I’m available for a call this Thursday at 2 PM. Let’s make sure we align on our strategy adjustments before you start your leave. We can use the conference line: (555) 012-3456, or feel free to suggest another if you prefer.

Looking forward to our discussion.

Best,  
Mike
