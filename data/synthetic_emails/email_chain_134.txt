Subject: Collaboration on Continuing Education Initiative  

Hi Annette,

I hope this email finds you well. As part of our ongoing efforts to enhance the skill set of our team at Merck, I'd like to discuss a potential collaboration for a new continuing education initiative. Given your expertise in project management and coordination, I believe your insights would be invaluable in structuring this program.

The initiative aims to integrate the latest pharmaceutical regulatory developments into our current curriculum. We plan to roll out the initial phase by the end of Q1 2024. I believe that with your hands-on experience, you could provide practical case studies and examples which would greatly benefit our participants.

Could we schedule a time to discuss this further? I am available for a call most afternoons next week. Alternatively, if you're in the Rahway office, we could meet in person. Please let me know what works for you.

Looking forward to your thoughts.

Best regards,

Hi Nathaniel,

Thank you for reaching out. I’m excited about the opportunity to contribute to the continuing education initiative. Incorporating regulatory updates into our curriculum is crucial for maintaining our competitive edge, and I'm eager to help bring this to fruition.

I’ll be in the Rahway office next Wednesday and would love to meet in person. How about we arrange a meeting at 2 PM in Conference Room B? This should give us ample time to discuss the proposed framework and identify key deliverables.

Please let me know if this works for you or if there’s another time that would be more convenient.

Looking forward to working together on this.

Best,
