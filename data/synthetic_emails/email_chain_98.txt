Subject: Coordination on Upcoming Pediatric Clinical Trial

Hi Annette,

I hope this message finds you well. I'm reaching out to discuss the upcoming pediatric clinical trial for the new respiratory therapy we're rolling out at the Children's Hospital. As the Theatre Manager, I'm coordinating the logistics on our end, and I wanted to ensure we're aligned with your team on the nursing protocols and scheduling.

Could we set up a time to discuss this in more detail? I believe it's crucial to align our resources and streamline the process for the trial's success. I'm available for a call this Thursday or Friday afternoon. Let me know what works best for you.

Also, please let me know if you have any specific requirements or concerns that we should address before the trial commences. My direct line is (555) 123-4567 if you need to reach me directly.

Looking forward to your input.

Best regards,

Gene Cunningham

Hi Gene,

Thank you for reaching out. I'm glad you initiated this conversation as it's critical for us to be on the same page for the trial. Thursday afternoon works perfectly for me. How about 2 PM? We can use the conference room on the third floor, or I can set up a virtual meeting if you prefer that.

In terms of nursing protocols, I’ve been reviewing our current guidelines and will prepare a draft to share with you during our meeting. Our primary focus will be on ensuring patient comfort and safety, particularly given the young age group involved. 

If there are any specific materials or equipment you'll need from our side, please let me know beforehand, so we can ensure everything is ready. I'll also loop in Dr. Patel, who will be overseeing the clinical aspects, to provide additional insights.

Looking forward to collaborating with you on this project. Please confirm if the proposed time works for you.

Best,
