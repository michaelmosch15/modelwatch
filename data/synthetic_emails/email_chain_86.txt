Hi Roberto,

I hope this message finds you well. I’m reaching out to discuss some details about the pension scheme options available to us here at Merck. As you might know, we’re ramping up the equipment maintenance schedules in Q4, and I’m trying to finalize some personal financial planning before things get too hectic.

Could you provide an overview of the different pension plans available? Specifically, I’m interested in any flexible options that might suit someone nearing a milestone year with the company. I’m also curious if there have been any recent updates to the contribution structure, especially given the industry shifts lately.

Please let me know a convenient time to discuss this further, or if there are any materials or resources you could send my way in the meantime.

Thanks in advance for your assistance!

Warm regards,

Hi Isabella,

Great to hear from you! I completely understand the need to get everything in order before the maintenance schedules take over. We have several pension scheme options that cater to different stages of career progression here at Merck.

Currently, we offer a Defined Contribution Plan and a Hybrid Plan, both of which have been recently updated to reflect enhanced matching contributions. The Hybrid Plan, in particular, might be of interest to you as it offers a balance of predictable returns and flexibility—ideal for someone who might be planning for significant career milestones.

I can send over a detailed brochure and a summary of the latest changes. Additionally, I’d be happy to set up a meeting to go over the specifics. Are you available this Thursday at 2 PM? We can meet in my office on the 5th floor, Room 502. Let me know if that works for you.

Looking forward to helping you out with this!

Best,
