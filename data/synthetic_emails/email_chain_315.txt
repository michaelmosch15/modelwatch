Hi Norman,

I hope this email finds you well. I’m reaching out to discuss our ongoing efforts to enhance diversity and inclusion within our team and across our practices at Merck. Given your role as a General Practice Doctor, your perspective would be invaluable to our upcoming training module, “Inclusive Healthcare Practices,” set to launch next month.

We are aiming to develop an inclusive environment that not only meets regulatory standards but also fosters a culture of empathy and understanding. Considering your extensive experience in patient care, I believe your input could greatly enrich our content.

Are you available for a brief meeting this Thursday at 2:00 PM? I’d love to pick your brain on integrating practical examples into our training. If that time doesn’t work, let me know your availability, and I'll do my best to accommodate.

Looking forward to your insights.

Best,

Hi Evelyn,

Thank you for reaching out. I’m glad to hear about the proactive steps we’re taking to improve our workplace culture. It's something I’m very passionate about, and I’d be happy to contribute.

Thursday at 2:00 PM works perfectly for me. I’ll prepare some notes on current practices and potential scenarios that might highlight the importance of diversity in patient interactions. We could meet at the Innovation Conference Room, if that suits you.

Additionally, I’ll be out of the office for a few days starting October 20th for a conference, so I’d like to ensure we have everything covered before then.

Looking forward to our discussion.

Best regards,
