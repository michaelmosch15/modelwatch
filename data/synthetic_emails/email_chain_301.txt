Hi Anna,

I hope this email finds you well. I’m reaching out to see if you’d be interested in collaborating on a new multimedia campaign we’re developing to promote mental health awareness within our organization. As you know, mental health is a critical area of focus for us at Merck, and we want to ensure that our message is both impactful and informative.

Given your expertise in mental health, your insights would be invaluable in shaping the content of the campaign. We are aiming to launch this initiative in November, so it would be great to discuss this with you before then. Could we possibly set up a time next week to brainstorm some ideas? I’m available for a call or a meeting at your convenience.

Looking forward to hearing your thoughts.

Best,

Hi Xavier,

Thank you for reaching out. I’m really excited about the opportunity to work on this mental health awareness campaign. It’s such an important cause, and I’m glad to see it being prioritized.

I would love to contribute my knowledge and experience to ensure we create a meaningful impact. Next week works for me; how about we schedule a meeting for Wednesday, October 18th in the afternoon? I’m available anytime after 1 PM. We can meet at my office on the second floor of Building 7, or I can join a video call if that’s more convenient for you.

Please let me know what works best, and we can finalize the details. Looking forward to collaborating with you.

Best regards,
