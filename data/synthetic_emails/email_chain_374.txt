**Subject:** Collaboration on Upcoming Product Launch Event

Hi Brian,

I hope this message finds you well. I'm reaching out to discuss the upcoming launch event for our new oncology therapy, set for November 20th. As the stage manager, I'm coordinating the logistics and production aspects of the event, and I believe a strong alignment with the marketing team will be crucial for its success.

Could we schedule a meeting this week to go over the event details and how we can effectively integrate your team's strategies into the presentation segments? I'm particularly interested in discussing the keynote speaker lineup and any targeted messaging you have in mind that should be highlighted during the event.

Please let me know your availability. I'm free on Thursday and Friday afternoon, and I can meet either in person at the Bluebell Conference Room or via Teams, whichever works best for you.

Looking forward to your input.

Best regards,

Hi Corey,

Thank you for reaching out. The launch event is indeed a critical milestone for us, and I'm glad to hear you're keen on aligning our efforts. Thursday afternoon works perfectly for me. Let's go with a 3 PM meeting in the Bluebell Conference Room; face-to-face discussions are always more productive.

I've been working on a preliminary outline for the marketing narrative and can share insights on our target demographics and how we plan to position the new therapy in the market. Additionally, it would be great to understand the stage layout and any technical capabilities we might leverage for immersive presentations.

I'll bring along a couple of concepts we've been developing for the opening sequence. Also, if we could touch on contingency plans for any last-minute changes, that would be helpful too.

Looking forward to our meeting.

Best,
