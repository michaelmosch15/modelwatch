Hi Perry,

I hope this message finds you well. I wanted to touch base regarding the upcoming shipment of the ophthalmic diagnostic equipment arriving at our main facility. As you know, these units are crucial for the new study we're launching on November 1st, focusing on pediatric strabismus.

Could you confirm the arrival date for these units? Also, it would be great if we could ensure priority storage to prevent any delays in distribution to the research teams. If there's any paperwork or coordination needed from our side, please let me know.

Thanks for your support, Perry. Looking forward to your confirmation.

Best,

Hi Duane,

Thanks for reaching out. I’ve checked with our logistics team, and the shipment is scheduled to arrive at the warehouse on October 20th. We’ve already earmarked a climate-controlled section for these units to ensure optimal storage conditions.

I’ll arrange for expedited handling upon arrival, so the units are ready for distribution by October 23rd. Please ensure that all necessary labeling and documentation are prepared in advance to facilitate a smooth process.

If you have any further specifications or need assistance, feel free to reach out. I'll be here until the 27th before I head out for a short leave. You can also contact my deputy, Lisa Tran, at ltran@example.org, during my absence.

Thanks,
