Hi Stacie,

I hope this message finds you well. I'm reaching out to discuss the upcoming Diversity & Inclusion campaign we're planning for Q4. As you know, this initiative is crucial for promoting a more inclusive workplace culture, and we want to ensure that our multimedia assets truly reflect our commitment to diversity.

Would you be available for a meeting this Thursday to brainstorm some ideas on how we can best represent diverse voices and stories within Merck? I think your insights as a Race Relations Officer would be invaluable in shaping the narrative and ensuring authenticity.

Please let me know your availability. Alternatively, you can reach me directly at extension 3478 if that's more convenient for you.

Looking forward to your thoughts!

Best,  
Rachael Graham

Hi Rachael,

Thanks for reaching out. The Diversity & Inclusion campaign sounds like a fantastic initiative, and I'm excited to contribute. Thursday works for me; I'm available anytime after 2 PM. Let's meet in the conference room on the 5th floor if that suits you.

I'd like to explore incorporating some of the feedback we've received from the recent employee surveys, especially around cultural representation and accessibility. It could provide a rich foundation for the multimedia content you're developing.

Let me know if there’s anything specific you’d like me to prepare ahead of our meeting.

Looking forward to collaborating!

Best regards,

P.S. I'll be on leave from October 20th to October 24th, so it would be great to finalize some key points before then.
