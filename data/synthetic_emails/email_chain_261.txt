Hi Pedro,

I hope this message finds you well. I’m reaching out to discuss the development of new ceramic vessels for our upcoming hydrographic sampling project set for Q1 next year. Given your expertise in ceramics and pottery design, I believe your input will be invaluable.

We’re looking to design vessels that can withstand prolonged exposure to saline environments while ensuring no chemical interference with our samples. The current prototypes have seen some degradation over time, and we’re keen on innovating with more robust materials.

Could we schedule a meeting to brainstorm potential designs? I’m available for a call or a meeting in the Sydney office next week. Let me know your availability.

Looking forward to your insights.

Best,

Hi Johnathan,

Thanks for reaching out. I’m excited about the opportunity to work on the new vessel designs. I agree that selecting the right materials is crucial to ensuring durability and sample integrity.

I have some ideas on using advanced ceramic composites that could potentially address the issues you mentioned. Let’s plan a meeting next week to go over these ideas and see how they align with your requirements. I’m available on Wednesday or Thursday afternoon. Just let me know what works best for you.

Also, just a quick note—I’ll be on leave from October 20th to October 27th, so it would be great if we can get the ball rolling before then.

Looking forward to collaborating.
