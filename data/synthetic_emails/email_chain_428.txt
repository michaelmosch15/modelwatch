Hi Dennis,

I hope this email finds you well. I’m reaching out to discuss an exciting opportunity for collaboration between our departments. As you know, Merck is keen on expanding its portfolio in the orthopedic segment, specifically regarding innovative solutions for foot health.

Given your expertise in ceramics design, I believe there’s potential for us to work together on developing a new line of orthopedic ceramic insoles. These would be tailored for patients requiring enhanced arch support and shock absorption. Your insights would be invaluable, particularly in ensuring the materials are both durable and comfortable for long-term use.

Could we schedule a meeting to explore this further? I’m available next week on Tuesday or Thursday afternoon. Let me know what works for you.

Looking forward to your thoughts.

Best,

Hi Melanie,

Thanks for reaching out. I’m thrilled about the possibility of collaborating on this project. The intersection of ceramics design and orthopedic applications is indeed an area with great potential for innovation.

I have some preliminary ideas on materials that could provide the necessary support while being lightweight and resilient. Additionally, I believe we can explore some eco-friendly options that align with Merck's sustainability goals.

Tuesday afternoon works perfectly for me. How about 2 PM at the Innovation Lab on the 5th floor? We can brainstorm and perhaps draft an initial project roadmap.

Looking forward to working together!
