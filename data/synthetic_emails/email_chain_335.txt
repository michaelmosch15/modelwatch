Hi Jake,

I hope this message finds you well. As part of our ongoing efforts to enhance operational safety within Merck, I've been reviewing the safety protocols related to the new software system your team is developing.

Could we schedule a meeting next week to discuss the integration of health and safety measures into the new system? I want to ensure we have robust protocols in place before the software goes live. I have a few concerns about the data handling processes that I'd like to address, particularly in terms of compliance with our industry standards.

I'm available Wednesday and Friday after 2 PM. Let me know what works for you.

Best regards,

Levi Peterson

Hi Levi,

Thanks for reaching out. I'm glad to hear you're taking a proactive approach to the new software's safety protocols. We definitely want to ensure everything aligns with Merck's high standards and regulatory requirements.

Wednesday after 2 PM works for me. Let's meet in my office on the 5th floor, Room 512. We can go through the data handling processes and any other concerns you have. In the meantime, I'll review the current protocols and bring along the latest documentation from our compliance team.

Looking forward to our discussion.

Best,
