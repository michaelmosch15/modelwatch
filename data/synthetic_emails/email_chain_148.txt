Hi Michele,

I hope this email finds you well. As we prepare for the upcoming Q3 financial report presentation scheduled for October 15, I wanted to touch base with you about some of the key points we'll need to cover. Given that this quarter has seen significant investments in our R&D pipeline, particularly with the new oncology products, it's crucial we highlight these in our presentation.

Could you please confirm if you have received the preliminary financial data I sent last week? Your insights on how to best present the financials, especially emphasizing our strategic initiatives and their projected ROI, would be invaluable.

I suggest we have a quick call to discuss the flow and any visual aids we might need. Let me know your availability this week. I'm generally free in the afternoons, except on Friday when I have a meeting with the auditors.

Looking forward to collaborating on this.

Best,

Hi Shannon,

Thanks for reaching out. Yes, I received the preliminary data, thank you for sending that over. I've started drafting some slides that incorporate those figures, particularly focusing on our R&D investments and their potential market impact.

I'm glad you mentioned the oncology products. I propose we dedicate a segment of the presentation to discuss our advancements in this area, as it aligns well with our strategic focus and showcases our commitment to innovation.

I'm available for a call tomorrow afternoon after 2 PM. Let me know if that works for you. Also, I’ll be out of the office next Thursday due to a conference in Boston, so I’d like to finalize the presentation details before then.

Talk soon,
