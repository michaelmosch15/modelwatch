Hi Yvette,

I hope this message finds you well. I am currently reviewing the details of claim #4598B related to the recent incident reported at our Rahway facility. The report mentions potential structural damage that might have affected both commercial and residential zones.

Could you provide a more detailed assessment of the extent of the damage and whether it impacts our current operational capabilities? We need to ensure that our risk management protocols align with your findings to process this claim accurately.

Additionally, please let me know if there's a convenient time this week for a quick call to discuss further. I'm available Tuesday and Thursday afternoons if that works for you.

Thank you for your assistance.

Best regards,

Hi Diana,

Thank you for reaching out. I have completed an initial survey of the Rahway facility, and indeed, there are a few areas of concern, particularly in the northern wing where the commercial labs are situated. The damage appears to involve both foundational and structural elements which could potentially disrupt some of our ongoing projects there.

I recommend a detailed structural integrity assessment to understand the full scope. I can coordinate with the facilities management team to expedite this if necessary.

As for a call, I am available Thursday afternoon at 2 PM. Let me know if this works for you, or suggest another time that might be more convenient.

Looking forward to resolving this swiftly.

Best,
