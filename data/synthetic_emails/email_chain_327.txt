Hi Dale,

I hope this message finds you well. I wanted to touch base regarding the regulatory documentation for the new oncology drug we are developing. As you know, precise language is crucial in these documents to meet FDA requirements and ensure compliance.

Could we schedule a meeting to review the current drafts of the documentation? It would be beneficial to have your legal expertise on the potential implications of certain terminologies we've used. I am available this Thursday or Friday afternoon. Let me know what works best for you.

Additionally, I will be out of the office next week for a family commitment, so it would be great to finalize our review before then.

Looking forward to your thoughts.

Best regards,

Hi Susan,

Thanks for reaching out. I completely agree that we need to be meticulous with the language in our regulatory documents, especially given the complexity of the new oncology drug.

Thursday afternoon works for me. How about 2:30 PM in the main conference room on the 12th floor? We should have everything we need there to go through the draft thoroughly.

I'll make sure to bring the latest legal reviews and any notes from our external consultants. Let's aim to iron out any ambiguities before your leave. Safe travels, by the way!

See you then.

Best,
