Subject: Collaboration on Upcoming Project Initiative

Hi Rhonda,

I hope this message finds you well. I wanted to reach out regarding the new project initiative we’re launching next quarter focused on enhancing our patient-centric product design strategies. Given your expertise in product design, I believe your insights could be invaluable.

We're currently in the initial planning phase, and I'd like to discuss how we can integrate your team's innovative design methodologies to align with our strategic goals. Are you available for a brief meeting next week to brainstorm? I’m flexible with timings, but preferably after 2 PM on any weekday.

Please let me know your availability, and we can coordinate a time that works best. Looking forward to your contributions to this exciting project.

Best regards,

Hi Terrence,

Thank you for reaching out. I’m thrilled to hear about the new project initiative. It sounds like a fantastic opportunity to leverage our design capabilities to further enhance our offerings.

Next week works for me. How about we schedule a meeting on Wednesday, November 15th at 3 PM? I can prepare some preliminary ideas on incorporating patient feedback loops into our design process, which I believe will be crucial for this project.

Let me know if this time suits you or if there’s any other information you would like me to bring to the meeting.

Looking forward to collaborating with you!

Best,
