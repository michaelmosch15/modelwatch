**Subject:** Q3 Sales Data & Budget Reconciliation  

Hi Sharon,

I hope this message finds you well. I'm reaching out regarding the Q3 sales data for the retail division. As you know, we're preparing for the upcoming budget reconciliation meeting scheduled for October 18th. 

I've noticed some discrepancies in the preliminary figures for the OTC products, particularly in the Northeast region. Could you take a look at the numbers when you have a moment? It's crucial we align everything before the presentation to the senior management team next week.

Additionally, I'm on annual leave starting October 20th, so I'd like to ensure that everything is in order before then. Please let me know a convenient time for us to discuss this further, or feel free to call me directly at (555) 987-6543.

Thanks for your assistance, Sharon. Looking forward to your insights.

Best,  
Shelia Erickson  
Retail Manager

Hi Shelia,

Thanks for bringing this to my attention. I've just reviewed the preliminary Q3 figures, and I agree that there seem to be some inconsistencies, especially with the OTC segment in the Northeast. I'll dig deeper into the data and cross-reference with our internal systems.

Let's aim to have a call tomorrow at around 2 PM, if that works for you. I want to ensure we have everything ironed out before your leave and the budget meeting. I'll also make sure to update the financial forecasts accordingly.

If there's anything else you need before our call, please let me know. I'll reach out to the finance team to expedite any required confirmations.

Looking forward to resolving this swiftly.

Best regards,
