Hi Miguel,

I hope this email finds you well. I wanted to touch base regarding the preliminary site evaluations for the new mineral sourcing project that we discussed last week. Based on our initial assessments, there are a few locations that require a more detailed survey to ensure they meet our compliance and sustainability standards.

Could you provide a timeline for when your team can conduct these surveys? Ideally, I’d like to have a full report by November 15, so we can integrate the findings into the Q4 planning session. Let me know if this timeline works for you or if there are any potential hurdles we should consider.

Please feel free to give me a call if you want to go over any specifics. You can reach me at my direct line, 555-482-7193.

Looking forward to your insights.

Best,  
Betty

Hi Betty,

Thanks for reaching out. I’m currently finalizing another project that’s due to wrap up by the end of this week, but I can allocate resources for the preliminary surveys starting October 23. I’ll aim to have a comprehensive report ready for you by November 10, which should give us ample time to make any necessary adjustments ahead of your Q4 session.

I’ll coordinate with my team to ensure we prioritize the sites flagged for potential compliance issues. Let’s set up a call early next week to discuss the specific criteria and any other parameters your team might have. I’ll be available Monday afternoon around 2 PM if that works for you.

Looking forward to collaborating on this initiative.

Best regards,  
Miguel
