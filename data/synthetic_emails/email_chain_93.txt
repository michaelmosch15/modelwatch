Hi Wyatt,

I hope this message finds you well. I’m reaching out regarding the recent feedback we've received from our call center regarding the packaging of our latest batch of Zestriva. We've noticed an uptick in customer queries about the packaging integrity.

Could you please look into the production line adjustments that were implemented last month? I suspect there might be a correlation between the changes and the issues we’re encountering. Any insights you can provide would be invaluable.

Let’s aim to have a quick sync-up later this week to discuss potential solutions. I’m available on Thursday afternoon—does that work for you? Feel free to call me directly at my office number: (908) 555-0142.

Thanks for your attention to this matter.

Best,  
Wayne Meza

Hi Wayne,

Thanks for bringing this to my attention. I’ve reviewed the logs from last month’s adjustments, and it appears there was a minor calibration change in the sealing process of the packaging line. This might be contributing to the integrity issues you've mentioned.

I’ll coordinate with the team to conduct a thorough inspection and revert to the previous settings if necessary. As for a meeting, Thursday afternoon works perfectly for me. Let’s say 2 PM? We can discuss the findings and outline any further steps.

Looking forward to resolving this promptly.

Best regards,
