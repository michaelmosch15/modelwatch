**Subject:** Review of Q3 Financial Forecast for R&D Initiatives  

Hi Caitlyn,

I hope this email finds you well. As we approach the end of Q3, I wanted to touch base regarding the financial forecasts for our ongoing R&D initiatives, particularly the Phase III clinical trials for the new oncology treatment.

Could you please review the attached financial projections and provide your insights? Your expertise would be invaluable in identifying any potential areas of concern that might impact our budget allocations. Given the strategic importance of these trials, ensuring alignment between our financial and research teams is crucial.

Also, I noticed that you'll be attending the Pharmaceutical Science World Congress next month in Geneva. If possible, could we schedule a brief call to discuss your findings before you leave? I’m available most afternoons this week.

Thanks in advance for your assistance.

Best regards,

Paul Summers

Hi Paul,

Thank you for sending over the financial projections. I’ve gone through the initial overview, and I’ll take a deeper dive into the numbers this afternoon. I agree that the oncology project is a pivotal part of our pipeline, and aligning our financial strategies is critical.

I'll make sure to have my feedback ready by Thursday. A quick call this Friday afternoon around 3 PM would be perfect to discuss any points in detail before my trip. Let me know if this works for you.

By the way, it was great to hear about your daughter’s recent academic achievement at the company picnic. Congratulations! It’s always nice to see our Merck family thriving both personally and professionally.

Looking forward to our discussion.

Best,
