Hi Olivia,

I hope this message finds you well. I wanted to follow up on your request regarding the availability of a dedicated space for your music therapy sessions at the Rahway campus. We have reviewed the schedule, and I’m pleased to inform you that Conference Room B in Building 3 is available on Mondays and Wednesdays from 1:00 PM to 3:00 PM.

Please let me know if these times work for your sessions. If they do, I will go ahead and reserve the room for you for the remainder of the quarter. I understand the importance of having a consistent and quiet space for your work, and I want to ensure we can accommodate your needs.

Feel free to reach out if you have any questions or if there’s anything else I can assist you with.

Best regards,

Subject: Room Availability for Music Therapy Sessions  

Hi Kristine,

I hope you’re having a great week so far. I am writing to inquire about the availability of a room where I can conduct music therapy sessions for employees. These sessions are part of our new well-being initiative aimed at reducing stress and enhancing productivity across teams.

Ideally, I would need the space twice a week for about two hours each session. A room that is relatively quiet and away from high-traffic areas would be perfect to ensure a conducive environment.

Could you please check the availability and let me know? I appreciate your help with this.

Thank you so much!

Warm regards,
