**Subject:** Follow-Up on Q4 Merchandising Strategies  

Hi Jesse,

I hope this message finds you well. As we gear up for the final quarter, I wanted to touch base regarding our merchandising strategies for the upcoming flu season. With the recent updates in our OTC product line, it's crucial that we align our approach to maximize visibility and sales in retail outlets.

Could we schedule a call early next week to discuss your insights from the field? It would be great to understand the current market dynamics from your perspective and how we can leverage our resources most effectively. I'm particularly interested in your thoughts on our new packaging designs and their potential impact.

Please let me know your availability. I'm generally free after 2 PM on Monday or Wednesday. Looking forward to hearing from you.

Best regards,

Don Stark

Hi Don,

Thanks for reaching out. I'm glad you brought this up, as I've noticed some interesting trends in customer preferences lately, especially with our updated OTC line. I completely agree that a strategic alignment is needed to optimize our retail presence as we head into flu season.

I can do a call on Monday at 3 PM. We can discuss the new packaging designs and I can provide some feedback based on recent interactions with key retail partners. Additionally, it might be worth considering a special promotional push for our top-performing lines.

Let me know if Monday at 3 works for you, or if there's another time that suits you better.

Best,
