Hi Francis,

I hope this email finds you well. As part of the preparations for the upcoming expansion of our facility in Rahway, I wanted to touch base with you regarding the comprehensive fire safety assessment that we need to conduct for the new site.

Given your expertise in surveying both commercial and residential spaces, your insights will be invaluable to ensure that our fire safety protocols are top-notch and compliant with industry standards. Could we schedule a walkthrough of the site next week? I’m aiming for either Wednesday or Thursday, preferably in the morning. Let me know which day works best for you.

Additionally, I’d appreciate it if you could bring along any recent reports or data from similar projects you’ve worked on. This would give us a solid reference point as we tailor the safety plan to our specific needs here at Merck.

Looking forward to collaborating with you on this crucial aspect of our project.

Best regards,

Hi Dustin,

Thanks for reaching out. I completely agree that a detailed safety assessment is essential as we gear up for the new facility development. Wednesday morning works perfectly for me, let’s aim for 10:00 AM. I’ll bring along the data from the recent surveys I conducted for our facilities in West Point, which should provide a solid benchmark.

Also, I’ll prepare some documentation on the latest compliance updates that might impact our safety strategy. It’s great to see us taking proactive steps in ensuring the safety of our employees and assets.

If you need to discuss anything prior to our meeting, feel free to give me a call at (732) 555-0234.

Looking forward to our collaboration.

Best,
