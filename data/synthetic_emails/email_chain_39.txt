Hi Bianca,

I hope this email finds you well. I wanted to touch base with you regarding the risk assessment report for the upcoming clinical trials on the new immunotherapy compound. As we discussed in last week's project meeting, it's crucial that we have a thorough analysis to ensure all potential risks are identified and mitigated before we proceed with the trial phases.

I've attached the preliminary draft of the report for your review. Could you please go through it and provide your insights, particularly focusing on any potential legal implications that might arise? Given your expertise in regulatory compliance, your input would be invaluable.

Additionally, I noticed that the timeline for the review coincides with your upcoming leave. If you could prioritize this task before your departure on October 10th, it would be greatly appreciated.

Let me know if there’s a convenient time to discuss this further.

Best regards,

Hi Dalton,

Thanks for sending over the draft. I’ll start reviewing it this afternoon and aim to have my feedback ready by the end of the week. I understand the urgency and will make sure to prioritize this before I head out for my leave next Tuesday.

I agree that identifying legal risks early on is crucial, especially considering the potential impact on our timeline and budget. I’ll focus on the sections related to compliance with FDA regulations and any liability issues that might arise during the patient recruitment phase.

Let's schedule a call for Thursday afternoon to go over my initial thoughts. Please let me know what time works best for you.

Looking forward to collaborating on this and ensuring a smooth process for the trials.

Best,
