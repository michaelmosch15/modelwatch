**Subject:** Collaboration on Upcoming Well-being Initiative

Hi Brandi,

I hope this message finds you well. I’m reaching out to discuss a potential collaboration that could benefit both our teams at Merck. As you know, we've been ramping up our efforts to integrate more comprehensive well-being initiatives across all divisions.

Given your expertise in geology and wellsite operations, I believe there’s a unique opportunity for us to tailor a program specifically aimed at improving mental and physical resilience for team members working in demanding field conditions. Your insights would be invaluable in understanding the specific stressors and challenges your team faces.

Could we schedule a meeting to brainstorm how we could structure this initiative? I’m available this Thursday or Friday after 2 PM. Let me know what works for you.

Looking forward to your thoughts.

Best,

Hi Jeanette,

Great to hear from you, and I’m excited about the possibility of collaborating on this initiative. The well-being of our field teams is a priority, and we’ve been looking for ways to enhance our current support systems.

I agree that a tailored program would be highly beneficial, especially considering the unique environmental and operational pressures we face. I am available this Thursday at 3 PM. We can meet in my office in the Green Building, Room 402, if that works for you.

Let’s also loop in Sam from the HR team; he’s been gathering feedback from the field staff which could be useful for our discussion.

Looking forward to our meeting.

Best regards,
