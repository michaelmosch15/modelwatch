Hi Chelsea,

I hope this email finds you well. I wanted to touch base regarding our ongoing Employee Wellness Initiative. Given your expertise in occupational psychology, I believe we could greatly enhance the mental health support we offer our staff.

As you know, the feedback from our recent wellness survey highlighted increased stress levels across several departments, particularly in R&D. I think a tailored approach could be beneficial here, and I'd love to get your insights on developing a program that addresses these specific challenges.

Could we schedule a meeting to discuss this further? I’m available this Friday after 2 PM. Alternatively, let me know what works best for you. I’m confident that by combining our efforts, we can make a significant positive impact on our colleagues’ well-being.

Looking forward to your thoughts.

Best,

Hi Wanda,

Thanks for reaching out! I completely agree that a targeted approach could make a huge difference, especially given the current challenges faced by our R&D team.

I’ve been reviewing some case studies on similar initiatives in the pharma sector and believe we could integrate some innovative strategies. Let’s definitely meet to brainstorm further. Friday after 2 PM works perfectly for me. We can meet at my office in Building 4, Room 217.

Also, I’ll be out of the office from October 23rd for a week, so it would be great to get things moving before then. I’ll bring along the survey data and some preliminary ideas to our meeting.

Looking forward to collaborating on this!

Best,
