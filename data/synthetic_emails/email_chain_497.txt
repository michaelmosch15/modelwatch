Hi Katrina,

I hope this message finds you well. As part of our ongoing effort to integrate more sustainable practices within our operations at Merck, I've been focusing on the Forest Stewardship Project we're piloting at the Rahway site. Given your expertise in careers guidance, I wanted to discuss how we can align these sustainability initiatives with career development opportunities for both current employees and new recruits.

We have a meeting scheduled next week with the Environmental Impact team on October 12th at 3 PM in Conference Room B, and it would be great if you could join us. We plan to discuss strategies for incorporating sustainable practices into our job roles, which could then be highlighted in our recruitment campaigns.

Let me know if you're available, or if there's another time that works better for you. I'm keen to hear your thoughts on how we can integrate these initiatives into our talent development programs.

Best regards,  
Tina Faulkner

Hi Tina,

Thank you for reaching out. The Forest Stewardship Project sounds like a fantastic initiative, and I absolutely agree that integrating sustainability into our career development programs is crucial.

I can attend the meeting on October 12th at 3 PM. It will be a great opportunity to brainstorm how we can effectively communicate our sustainability goals to potential candidates and existing staff. Perhaps we can even consider developing a set of sustainability-focused training modules or workshops to enhance our current offerings.

Looking forward to our discussion next week. Please let me know if there's anything specific you would like me to prepare ahead of the meeting.

Best,
