**Subject:** Request for Archived Research Data Access  

Hi Jill,

I hope this message finds you well. I'm reaching out to request access to archived research data related to the Z-Pharma initiative from 2019. We're preparing for a regulatory compliance audit set for November 15th, and having this data will be instrumental in ensuring our documentation is thorough and up to date.

Could you please let me know the process to access these archives? Additionally, if there are any specific forms or approvals needed, kindly guide me through them.

Let me know if you require any more details from my end. I appreciate your assistance on this matter.

Best,

Hi Madison,

Thank you for reaching out. To access the archived data for the Z-Pharma initiative, you'll need to fill out the Archive Access Request Form, which I've attached to this email. Once completed, please send it back to me, and I'll expedite the approval process with our Records Management team.

In terms of timeline, since you mentioned the audit is on November 15th, I'll prioritize this request to ensure you have what you need well in advance. Typically, it takes about 5-7 business days to process, but I'll do my best to have it ready sooner.

If you have any trouble with the form or need further assistance, feel free to call me directly at (555) 678-9012. Also, just a heads up, I'll be out of the office for a few days next week starting Tuesday for a family commitment, so let's aim to get this sorted by Monday if possible.

Looking forward to your completed form.

Best regards,  
Jill Trujillo
