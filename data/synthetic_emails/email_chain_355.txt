**Subject:** Coordination on Upcoming Video Shoot for New Product Launch  

Hi Jackie,

I hope this email finds you well. I wanted to touch base regarding the video shoot for the JunoVax campaign scheduled for October 15th. Given the importance of this launch, it's crucial that we capture the dynamic aspects of the new product effectively.

Could you confirm your availability for the shoot day? Also, it would be great to have a preliminary discussion about the equipment we'll need to bring on site. I believe using the new 4K cameras could really enhance the visual quality, especially for the close-up shots of the product in action.

Let's aim to have a detailed rundown meeting early next week. How does Tuesday, October 10th, at 3 PM sound to you? We can meet in the conference room on the 5th floor, or if it’s more convenient, we can have a quick Zoom call.

Please let me know your thoughts. Looking forward to collaborating on this exciting project!

Best,

Hi Malik,

Thanks for looping me in on the details. I'm definitely available on October 15th and agree that the 4K cameras will be essential for capturing the intricate details of JunoVax. I’ll ensure all equipment is prepped and ready for the shoot day.

Tuesday, October 10th at 3 PM works perfectly for our rundown meeting. Let's meet in the conference room on the 5th floor as suggested. I’ll bring along a checklist of the gear and any additional accessories we might need.

Also, just a heads-up, I’ll be on leave from October 18th for a week, so if there are any post-production details to discuss, it would be great to cover them before then.

Looking forward to bringing this project to life with you!

Cheers,
