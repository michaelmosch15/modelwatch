Hi Jay,

I hope this message finds you well.

I'm currently reviewing the budget allocations for our upcoming Q1 2024 research projects, particularly focusing on the new enzyme synthesis initiative. As you know, ensuring we have the appropriate funding in place is crucial to meet our development milestones on time.

Could you provide me with a preliminary financial overview for this project? Specifically, I need to understand how much we have earmarked for materials and testing phases. Additionally, if there are any new financial guidelines or updates for 2024 that I should be aware of, please let me know.

Let's aim to finalize the budget by October 20th to ensure a smooth kickoff in January. If you’re available, I’d appreciate setting up a quick call this week to discuss any potential adjustments.

Thanks in advance for your help!

Best,

Hi Katherine,

Great to hear from you!

I've had a chance to look at the preliminary figures for the enzyme synthesis project. As it stands, we have allocated a tentative budget of $2.5 million for Q1 2024. This includes provisions for both materials and initial testing phases, but we might need to reassess based on the latest supplier quotes and any unforeseen regulatory costs.

Regarding financial guidelines, we will have a detailed briefing next week, but I can confirm that we should expect a 5% increase in overheads due to new compliance measures being implemented. I’ll send over a more detailed breakdown by end of day tomorrow.

I am available for a call on Thursday around 2 PM if that suits you. Let me know if this works or if there’s a better time for you.

Looking forward to ensuring we have everything lined up seamlessly!

P.S. I’ll be on leave starting October 23rd, so let's make sure we wrap this up before then.
