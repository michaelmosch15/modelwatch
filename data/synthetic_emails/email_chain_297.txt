Subject: Coordination for Upcoming Press Event

Hi Terrance,

I hope this message finds you well. I'm reaching out to discuss the logistics for the upcoming press event scheduled for October 25th at our Boston office. As you know, this event is crucial for unveiling our new oncology research findings, and we want to ensure everything runs smoothly, especially in terms of media coverage.

Could you confirm your availability to handle the photography for the event? It's set to start at 10:00 AM, but it would be great if you could arrive by 9:00 AM to capture some behind-the-scenes shots and set up your equipment.

Please let me know if you need any additional information or specific access to certain areas within the facility. Also, if there are any equipment or logistical needs you have, feel free to inform me so I can coordinate with the facilities team.

Looking forward to your confirmation.

Best regards,

Eric Wilkinson

Hi Eric,

Thanks for reaching out. I’m available for the press event on the 25th and will be there by 9:00 AM as requested. I’ll make sure to bring all necessary gear to capture both the event and some of those candid moments that tell the story behind our research breakthroughs.

I’d appreciate it if you could arrange for a quick walkthrough upon my arrival, just to finalize any specifics regarding lighting and vantage points. I’ll follow up with the facilities team today to ensure we’re all set on that front.

Also, please let me know if there are any particular executives or guest speakers you’d like me to focus on for specific shots.

Looking forward to another successful event!

Best,
