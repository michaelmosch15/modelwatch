Hi Cesar,

I hope this email finds you well. I wanted to touch base regarding the upcoming product launch for the new oncology treatment, Lumexa. We’re in the final stages of preparing the printed materials, and I understand your team will be handling the translation into Spanish and French.

Could we schedule a brief meeting this week to align on timelines and ensure we’re on track? I’m keen to avoid any last-minute hiccups. I’m available on Thursday or Friday morning. Please let me know what works for you.

Also, just a quick note that I’ll be out of the office next week attending the Print Production Summit in Boston, so I’d like to wrap up as much as possible before then.

Thanks,

Hi Curtis,

Thanks for reaching out. It's crucial that we ensure accuracy for such a significant launch. Thursday morning works perfectly for me. How about 10:00 AM? We can meet in Conference Room B on the 5th floor.

I'll bring our current drafts so we can review them together and finalize any pending adjustments. I’ll make sure our lead translators are looped in as well to address any specific queries you might have.

Enjoy the summit next week! I hear it's going to be quite insightful this year. Let me know if there’s anything specific you’d like me to cover while you’re away.

Looking forward to our meeting.

Best,
