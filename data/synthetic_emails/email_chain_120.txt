Hi Kaylee,

I hope this message finds you well. I'm reaching out to discuss the maintenance records for our facility equipment, particularly the HVAC systems and the centrifuges used in our research labs.

As you know, we need to ensure all our records are up-to-date for the upcoming internal audit scheduled for October 25th. I've noticed some discrepancies in the log entries for last quarter and would like to cross-reference these with your records.

Could you please provide me with the latest copies of the maintenance logs? I want to make sure everything aligns with our standard operating procedures and regulatory requirements. Let me know if you need any specific details from my end.

Looking forward to your response.

Best,

Hi Xavier,

Thank you for reaching out. I understand the importance of having these records in order before the audit. I have pulled the maintenance logs for the HVAC systems and centrifuges from the past two quarters. I will double-check for any discrepancies and send them over to you before the end of the day.

If you notice any specific issues you want to discuss, feel free to give me a call. I'll be at my desk in the main office (Room 312) until around 3 PM today, after which I'll be attending a training session on the new records management software.

I'll make sure the records are thoroughly reviewed and aligned with your data. Please also let me know if there are any specific areas you want me to pay extra attention to.

Best regards,  
Kaylee Mason

Hi Kaylee,

I appreciate your prompt response and your help on this matter. I'll take a detailed look at the logs once you send them over and will get back to you if there are any issues. 

I’ll also stop by your office around 2:30 PM to discuss a couple of points if you’re available. Thanks again for your support.

Talk soon,  
Xavier
