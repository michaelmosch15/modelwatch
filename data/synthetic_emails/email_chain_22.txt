Hi Tracy,

I hope this message finds you well. I am reaching out to discuss the upcoming Analytical Chemistry Workshop scheduled for November 15th at the Merck Research Facility in Rahway. As a part of our continuous education series, we're keen on having an expert from your team to conduct a session on advanced analytical techniques in drug development.

Given your expertise in this field, I believe you would be an invaluable contributor to the program. We expect around 50 participants, largely from our R&D departments, and a few external stakeholders. Your insights on recent advancements and best practices in analytical methodologies could truly enhance the workshop's impact.

Please let me know if you're available on that day and interested in participating. We can arrange for a preliminary call to discuss the session details further.

Looking forward to your response.

Best regards,

Samuel Saunders

Hi Samuel,

Thank you for reaching out. The workshop sounds like a fantastic initiative, and I would be delighted to contribute. I am available on November 15th and would be happy to lead a session on analytical techniques, especially focusing on chromatography and spectroscopy applications in drug development.

Let's set up a call next week to discuss the specifics. I’m available on Monday or Wednesday afternoon. Also, please let me know if there are any particular topics or case studies you want me to emphasize.

Looking forward to collaborating on this and contributing to the professional development of our teams.

Best regards,
