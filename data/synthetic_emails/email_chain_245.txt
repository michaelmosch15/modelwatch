Hi Joy,

I hope this email finds you well. I'm reaching out to discuss the upcoming Sustainable Landscape Initiative that we discussed during last month's team meeting. As you are aware, Merck is committed to integrating sustainable practices across all our operations, and this initiative is a key component of our environmental strategy for 2024.

Given your expertise in landscape architecture, I believe your input will be invaluable in designing a layout that not only complements our existing facilities but also enhances our sustainability goals. Specifically, I'm interested in exploring the use of native plant species to reduce water usage and maintenance costs at the West Point site.

Could we schedule a time to discuss this further? I'm available for a call this Thursday after 2 PM. Let me know if that works for you or if there's another time that would be more convenient.

Looking forward to your insights.

Best,

Hi Cynthia,

Thanks for reaching out. I'm excited to contribute to the Sustainable Landscape Initiative. Integrating native plants is a fantastic approach, and I have some ideas on how we can incorporate them into our design to maximize environmental benefits while maintaining aesthetic appeal.

Thursday after 2 PM works perfectly for me. Let's aim for a call at 2:30 PM. I'll prepare some preliminary sketches and data on regional plant species that have been successful in similar projects.

Also, just a heads-up, I'll be on leave starting next Wednesday for a week, so it would be great to finalize some preliminary plans before then. Feel free to call me directly if you need to discuss anything urgently before our meeting.

Looking forward to our collaboration.

Best regards,
