Hi Mario,

I hope this email finds you well. As I understand it, you’re coordinating the upcoming facility tours for our external partners and stakeholders. I wanted to touch base regarding the content that will be presented during the tours.

We’ve been working on some new educational material that highlights our recent advancements in oncology and vaccine development. I believe incorporating these into the tour could significantly enhance our guests' understanding of our current projects and innovations. Could you let me know what sections of the tour would be most suitable for this content? Additionally, if there are any specific areas you think should be highlighted, please let me know.

Also, I’ll be out of the office next week starting October 16, but I can be reached by phone if you need to discuss anything urgently. My number is (555) 012-3456.

Looking forward to your thoughts.

Best,

Hi Yvette,

Thank you for reaching out. The new content sounds perfect for the tours and aligns well with our goal of showcasing Merck's cutting-edge work. We can integrate the oncology and vaccine development segments into the R&D lab visit and the Q&A session at the end of the tour. These parts of the tour are typically where our guests are most engaged and curious about our latest advancements.

I will coordinate with the R&D team to ensure they’re prepared to discuss these topics in detail. If you have a draft or any specific points you’d like them to cover, please send it over by the end of this week. Additionally, if you have any visuals or handouts, our Marketing Department can assist with production.

Enjoy your time off next week! I’ll make sure to reach out only if absolutely necessary.

Best regards,  
Mario Coffey  
Tour Manager, Merck
