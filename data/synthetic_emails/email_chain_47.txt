Hi Tanya,

I hope this message finds you well. I am reaching out to discuss the upcoming pharmaceutical conference scheduled for November 15-17 in Chicago, where Merck will have a booth. As the set designer, I am responsible for the visual and spatial aspects of our presentation, and I believe your expertise as a Medical Technical Officer would be invaluable in ensuring our booth effectively communicates our latest medical advancements.

Could you provide insights into the key products and technologies we should highlight? Your technical knowledge would help us create an engaging and informative experience for attendees. Additionally, if you have any specific ideas or requirements for interactive elements or demonstrations, please let me know.

I am available for a meeting this week if you’d like to discuss this in more detail. Feel free to suggest a time that works for you.

Looking forward to your input.

Best regards,

Vernon Alexander

Hi Vernon,

Thanks for reaching out. I’d be delighted to collaborate with you on the booth design. The conference is a fantastic opportunity for us to showcase Merck’s cutting-edge research and innovations.

Given the recent developments in our oncology and vaccines pipelines, I would suggest we put a strong focus on these areas. We could create interactive displays that allow attendees to explore how our treatments work at a cellular level. I also recommend incorporating augmented reality elements to make the experience more immersive.

Let’s meet to brainstorm further. How about Wednesday at 2 PM? We can meet in the conference room on the 5th floor of the East Wing. Let me know if this time suits you, or if you’d prefer another slot.

Looking forward to crafting something impactful together.

Warm regards,
