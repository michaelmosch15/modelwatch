Hi Marco,

I hope this message finds you well. I am reaching out to discuss the upcoming Health Policy Forum scheduled for November 15th. As you know, this event will be crucial for strengthening our partnerships with key stakeholders and showcasing our commitment to healthcare innovation.

Given the importance of this event, I believe it would be beneficial to have a representative from Human Resources to discuss our diversity and inclusion initiatives as part of our broader corporate social responsibility strategy. Could you let me know if you or someone from your team would be available to participate?

Additionally, please advise if there are any specific HR materials or presentations we should prepare that align with our current projects, such as the "Future Leaders in Pharma" initiative. We want to ensure that our messaging is cohesive and impactful.

Looking forward to your thoughts.

Best,

Hi Olivia,

Thank you for reaching out. The Health Policy Forum sounds like a fantastic opportunity to highlight our HR initiatives, especially those related to diversity and inclusion. I’d be happy to attend and contribute to the discussions.

I can prepare a brief presentation on our "Future Leaders in Pharma" initiative, focusing on our strategies to attract and retain diverse talent. I’ll also coordinate with my team to gather any additional materials we might need.

Could you please confirm the forum’s location and agenda details when they are finalized? I want to ensure we tailor our content appropriately.

Looking forward to collaborating on this. Please let me know if there's anything else you need from our side.

Best regards,
