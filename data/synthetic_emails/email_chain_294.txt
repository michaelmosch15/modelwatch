Hi Maxwell,

I hope this email finds you well. As part of our quarterly financial review, I've been going over the energy efficiency metrics for Q3, and I noticed a few variances that I think might need your input. Specifically, there seems to be an unusual spike in energy consumption at the Westfield Manufacturing Plant during August. 

Could you please provide any insights or additional data that might explain this anomaly? It would be beneficial for both our teams if we ensure that all metrics align with our sustainability goals and cost management strategies.

Additionally, I'm finalizing the preparation for the upcoming financial reports and need to have this clarified by the end of the week. Would you be available for a quick call tomorrow at 3 PM to discuss this? Let me know if that works for you or if there's another time that suits better.

Thanks for your assistance, and I appreciate your prompt attention to this matter.

Best regards,

Hi Willie,

Thanks for reaching out. I had noticed the spike as well and have been investigating the root cause over the past few days. Preliminary findings suggest it may be related to a temporary increase in production to meet an urgent order, coupled with some HVAC maintenance issues that were resolved shortly after.

I can pull together a more detailed report and share it with you before our call. The proposed time of 3 PM tomorrow works well for me. I'll make sure to have all relevant data on hand so we can sync up efficiently.

Also, just a heads-up—I’ll be out of the office for a conference in Chicago from October 16-18, so if there’s anything else we need to cover, it’d be great to wrap up before then.

Looking forward to our call.

Best,
