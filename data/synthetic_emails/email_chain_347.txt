**Subject:** Discussion on Cognitive Health Study Protocol  

Hi Roberta,

I hope this message finds you well. I wanted to reach out regarding the new cognitive health study we're developing. I’ve been reviewing the initial protocol drafts and wanted to get your insights, particularly concerning the neuro-assessment methodologies we're employing.

Given your expertise in neurosurgery, your input would be invaluable in refining the sections on surgical outcomes related to cognitive function post-treatment. I’m particularly interested in your thoughts on integrating neuroplasticity metrics into our assessments, as it seems crucial for capturing the full scope of patient recovery.

Could we perhaps schedule a call to discuss this further? I'm available later this week on Thursday or Friday. Let me know what works for you. Additionally, if there's any literature or data from your recent projects you could share, it would greatly enhance our approach.

Looking forward to your thoughts.

Best regards,

Hi Brent,

Thank you for reaching out. I’ve had a chance to glance through the protocol drafts, and I agree that incorporating neuroplasticity metrics is a vital step forward. In recent projects, we’ve seen significant benefits in monitoring these aspects for predicting patient recovery trajectories.

I’d be happy to discuss this in more detail. How about we set up a meeting for Thursday at 3 PM? I can forward some relevant studies and data from our latest surgical outcomes that might be beneficial for reference.

By the way, I’ll be out of the office early next week for a conference in Boston, but I'll ensure that our discussion is followed up promptly before I leave.

Looking forward to our conversation.

Best,
