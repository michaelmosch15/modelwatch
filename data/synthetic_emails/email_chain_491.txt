Hi Mackenzie,

I hope this email finds you well. I'm reaching out regarding the new promotional materials for the Varian TrueBeam™ Radiotherapy System that we're planning to roll out next month. I've attached a draft of the copy that needs your expertise.

Could you please review the technical sections to ensure everything aligns with the latest clinical guidelines and technological specifications? Your input would be invaluable, especially regarding the device's adaptive capabilities and patient safety features.

We are on a tight schedule, aiming to finalize the content by the end of next week to meet the publishing deadline. If you could get back to me by Friday, October 20th, it would be greatly appreciated.

Let's also schedule a quick call later this week to discuss any potential changes. I'm available Thursday afternoon after 3 PM. Let me know what works for you.

Thanks so much, Mackenzie!

Best,

Hi Susan,

Thanks for reaching out. I’ve just taken a look at the draft you attached. The overall direction looks great! I’ll dive deeper into the technical details tomorrow and ensure everything is accurate and compliant with the latest standards.

Could we push our call to Friday morning instead? I have a few meetings lined up Thursday afternoon, but I'm free at 10 AM on Friday. Let me know if that works for you.

Also, just a heads up, I'll be on leave starting October 25th for a week. Let's aim to wrap everything up before then to avoid any delays.

Looking forward to collaborating on this exciting launch!
