**Subject:** Review Needed: New Advertising Campaign Script for Compliance  

Hi Michael,

I hope this email finds you well. I’m reaching out to request your expertise on compliance for our latest advertising campaign for the new cholesterol-lowering medication, Liprova.

I’ve attached the draft script for the commercial that we’re planning to pitch next week. Given the strict guidelines in the pharmaceutical industry, I want to ensure that all claims and representations in the script align with regulatory standards before we proceed further.

Could you please review the document and share your insights by Thursday, October 19th? Your feedback will be invaluable in ensuring we are fully compliant.

If you have any questions or need further information, feel free to call me directly at (555) 782-4301. I’m in the office from 9 AM to 5 PM, and happy to discuss this at your convenience.

Thank you for your assistance!

Best regards,

Hi Debbie,

Thanks for sending over the draft script. I’ve gone through it and made some initial comments directly in the document regarding the phrasing of efficacy claims and the required disclaimers. Overall, it looks great, but we need to ensure that we’re not inadvertently overpromising on the benefits.

I’ve flagged a few sections where we might need to tone down the language or add more context about potential side effects. It’s crucial that we maintain transparency to comply with the Advertising Standards Authority regulations here in Scotland.

I’ll make it a priority to finalize my review by your requested deadline, October 19th. Let’s have a quick call once I’ve completed my review to go over any potential red flags. I’m available tomorrow afternoon, so just let me know what works for you.

Looking forward to nailing this campaign!

Best,
