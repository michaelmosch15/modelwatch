Hi Mindy,

I hope this message finds you well. As you know, we're gearing up for the launch of our new IVF product line set for Q1 2024, and I wanted to touch base with you regarding your invaluable insights as an embryologist.

Given your expertise in clinical embryology, your input will be crucial in fine-tuning the final presentation materials, especially the technical specifications and the potential impact on clinical outcomes. Could we schedule a meeting next week to discuss how best to integrate your feedback into our go-to-market strategy? I’m particularly keen on your thoughts about the latest clinical trial data and how it aligns with our marketing narratives.

Please let me know your availability. I'm flexible most mornings, but Tuesday is booked with leadership reviews. Reach out to me at (555) 019-2837 at your convenience.

Looking forward to collaborating on this exciting project!

Best,  
Heather

Hi Heather,

Thanks for reaching out. I'm thrilled to be part of the team working on the new IVF product line. I completely agree that aligning the clinical data with the marketing strategy is crucial, and I’m eager to contribute.

Next week, I'm available on Wednesday and Thursday mornings. How about we pencil in a meeting at 10:00 AM on Wednesday? We can meet in Conference Room B at the main office, which should have all the necessary AV equipment for reviewing the trial data and presentations.

Also, just a heads-up—I’ll be out of the office starting October 23rd for a conference in Chicago, so it would be ideal to finalize our discussion before then.

Let me know if Wednesday works for you.

Best regards,  
Mindy
