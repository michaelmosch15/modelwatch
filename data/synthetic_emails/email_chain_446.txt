**Subject:** Coordination for Upcoming Radio Segment on Sustainable Practices  

Hi Yesenia,

I hope this email finds you well. I am reaching out to discuss the upcoming radio segment we have scheduled for November 10th on Merck's sustainable practices in pharmaceuticals. As our leading tree surgeon, your insights into how we are incorporating eco-friendly practices into our supply chain would be invaluable.

Our goal with this segment is to highlight Merck's commitment to sustainability and innovative approaches to reducing our carbon footprint. It would be great to have a quote or two from you about the recent initiatives you've been involved in, especially any projects focused on sustainable sourcing of raw materials.

Could we schedule a brief call to go over the details and see how we can best integrate your expertise into the segment? I’m available this Thursday or Friday afternoon. Please let me know what works for you.

Looking forward to collaborating on this.

Best,

Hi Mackenzie,

Thank you for reaching out! I'm thrilled to be a part of the segment and share what we've been working on. Our recent project on sustainable harvesting practices for medicinal plants has been a major success, and I'd love to discuss it on air.

Thursday afternoon works perfectly for me. How about we connect at 2 PM? I'll make sure to have some key points prepared on our sustainability initiatives and how they're impacting our operations positively.

Please let me know if there's anything specific you'd like me to cover or if you need any additional information beforehand. I will be in the office in Rahway, so feel free to call my direct line at (555) 987-6543.

Looking forward to our conversation!

Best regards,  
Yesenia Phelps
