Subject: Collaboration on Upcoming Office Renovation Project  

Hi Jordan,

I hope this message finds you well. I’m reaching out to discuss the upcoming office renovation project that’s scheduled to start next month in our Rahway facility. As you may already know, we’re looking to update our workspaces to better reflect Merck’s innovative spirit and enhance productivity.

I understand that your team will be handling the media components of the project, and I wanted to touch base to discuss how we might integrate some of the restored furniture pieces we’re working on. These pieces could potentially be featured in any promotional materials or media tours, showcasing Merck’s commitment to sustainability and heritage.

Could we set up a time to discuss this further? I’m available for a call or meeting next week, preferably on Tuesday or Thursday afternoon. Let me know what works best for you.

Looking forward to collaborating with you on this.

Best,  
Angelica

Hi Angelica,

Thanks for reaching out. I’m excited about the potential to feature your restored pieces in our media initiatives. Incorporating elements of sustainability into our promotional content aligns perfectly with the current branding strategy we’re developing for the renovation project.

Tuesday afternoon works well for me. How about 2:00 PM? We can meet in the main conference room at the Rahway office. I’ll bring along some initial drafts of our media plan so we can brainstorm the best ways to highlight your work.

Also, I’ll be out on leave starting November 10th, so I’d like to wrap up our plans by the first week of November to ensure a smooth handover to my team.

Looking forward to our meeting.

Best regards,  
Jordan
