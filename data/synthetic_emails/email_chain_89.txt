Hi Ricardo,

I hope this message finds you well. I wanted to touch base regarding the upcoming project review meeting scheduled for October 24th. As you know, we’ll be discussing the progress of the new automated vial filling system as part of our continuous improvement initiatives in the manufacturing department.

Could you please confirm whether you’ll be able to present the latest developments on the drilling and installation phase? Your insights are crucial, as they directly impact our timelines and resource allocations, especially given the recent modifications to the system design.

Additionally, if there are any specific materials or data you need from my end, feel free to let me know. I can coordinate with the facilities team to ensure everything is ready for your presentation.

Looking forward to your confirmation.

Best regards,

Hi Gina,

Thank you for reaching out. I can confirm my availability for the project review meeting on October 24th. I’ll prepare a detailed update on the drilling and installation phase, which has been progressing well despite some initial challenges with equipment calibration.

I’ll need access to the latest performance metrics from the quality assurance team to align my presentation with our operational goals. If you could facilitate that, it would be greatly appreciated.

Also, just a heads up, I'll be on leave from October 30th to November 3rd, so I’ll ensure all deliverables are on track before then. Let me know if there’s anything else you need from my side.

Looking forward to our continued collaboration.

Best,
