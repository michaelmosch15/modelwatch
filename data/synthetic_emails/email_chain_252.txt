Hi Ronnie,

I hope this message finds you well. As you may know, we've had reports of some structural concerns at the new rural distribution facility in Lancaster. Given your expertise, I believe your involvement in assessing any potential losses would be invaluable.

Could we coordinate a site visit next week? I’d like to ensure we have all bases covered from both a surveying and loss adjustment perspective. I’m available on Tuesday or Thursday. Let me know what works for you.

Also, please find attached the preliminary survey report. It should give you a clearer picture of the current situation. Feel free to call me at (555) 123-4567 if you have any questions or need further details before the visit.

Looking forward to your input.

Best regards,

Jerome Roman

Hi Jerome,

Thanks for reaching out and sharing the preliminary report. I had a quick glance, and it does seem like there's some work to be done to mitigate potential risks.

I'm available on Thursday for the site visit. Let’s aim for 10 AM, if that works for you. I’ll prepare the necessary documentation for the damage assessment and bring along some equipment to conduct a thorough examination.

Also, just a heads up, I'll be on leave from October 23rd, so I’d like to ensure we have a comprehensive understanding and plan in place before then.

Feel free to drop me a line if you need to discuss anything further. Otherwise, I’ll see you at the site.

Best,
