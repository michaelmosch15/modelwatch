**Subject:** Collaboration on New Rehabilitation Protocols for Post-Clinical Trials  

Hi Karla,

I hope this message finds you well. I’m reaching out to discuss the recent clinical trial data for the neuromodulation therapy we’ve been developing. Given your expertise in occupational therapy, I believe your insights would be invaluable in crafting effective rehabilitation protocols for patients post-trial.

We’ve observed some promising outcomes, but integrating these into a standardized rehabilitative process is crucial. Could we schedule a meeting next week to brainstorm? I’m available Wednesday and Thursday after 2 PM. Let me know what works best for you.

Looking forward to your thoughts.

Best regards,

Hi Mikayla,

Thank you for reaching out. I’m thrilled to hear about the positive outcomes from the neuromodulation therapy trials. It’s essential that we ensure smooth integration into our rehabilitation programs to maximize patient recovery and support.

I can meet on Wednesday at 3 PM. Does that work for you? We can use the conference room on the 5th floor, or I can book a virtual meeting if you prefer. Also, I’ll be on leave from the 15th to the 20th of this month, so I hope we can get things rolling before then.

Looking forward to collaborating on this important project!

Best,
