Hi Nina,

I hope this message finds you well. I'm reaching out to request your assistance with a contract review for Project Orion. As you know, we're moving into the next phase of the project, and I want to ensure that all legal aspects are thoroughly vetted before we proceed.

Could you please take a look at the attached draft when you have the chance? I am particularly concerned about the indemnity clauses and any potential compliance issues with recent FDA regulations. 

Additionally, if possible, could we schedule a meeting next week to discuss any red flags you might identify? I'm available on Tuesday and Thursday after 1 PM, but I can adjust my schedule if needed.

Thanks so much for your help with this. Feel free to call me at (555) 012-3456 if you have any immediate questions.

Best,  
Jenna Vasquez  
Technical Sales Engineer

Hi Jenna,

Thank you for sending the contract draft for Project Orion. I'll start reviewing it today and aim to have my initial feedback by the end of the week. I’ll pay special attention to the indemnity clauses and compliance with FDA regulations, as requested.

Regarding our meeting, Thursday after 1 PM works perfectly for me. Let's plan to meet in Conference Room B at the West Point office.

Also, just a heads-up that I'll be on leave starting October 20th for a week, so if there are any urgent matters, we should aim to address them before then.

I'll keep you posted on my progress.

Best regards,  
Nina Shepard
