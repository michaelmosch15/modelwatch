Hi Deanna,

I hope this message finds you well. I’m reaching out to discuss the upcoming collaborative project between the Museum Education team and the Bookseller division. As you know, we’re in the early stages of developing an educational program that aligns with Merck’s mission to increase public awareness about pharmaceutical sciences.

Our preliminary idea is to create a series of interactive workshops and seminars at the museum, focusing on the history and impact of pharmaceuticals. We believe your expertise in curating educational materials and resources will be invaluable to this project. Could we schedule a time to meet and discuss your input and potential contributions?

I’m hoping we can meet sometime next week. I’m available Tuesday and Thursday afternoons, but I’m flexible if those don’t work for you. Looking forward to collaborating and bringing this educational initiative to life.

Best regards,

Richard Sparks

Hi Richard,

Thank you for reaching out! I’m excited about the opportunity to collaborate on this educational program. It’s truly inspiring to see Merck’s commitment to public education and awareness in the pharmaceutical field.

Your proposal for interactive workshops and seminars sounds like a great approach. I can see how this could effectively engage a broad audience and make complex topics more accessible. I’d be thrilled to contribute by helping design the educational materials and suggesting relevant books and resources that align with your themes.

I’m available Thursday afternoon next week. Let’s say 2 PM? We could meet at the museum café if that works for you. I’ll bring along some preliminary ideas for discussion.

Looking forward to our meeting!

Best,

Hi Deanna,

Thursday at 2 PM works perfectly for me. The museum café is a great choice, and I’ll make sure to reserve a table for us. I’m eager to hear your ideas and explore how we can integrate them into the program.

Thank you for your enthusiasm and readiness to collaborate. See you next week!

Cheers,
