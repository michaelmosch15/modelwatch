Hi Brent,

I hope this message finds you well. I'm reaching out to discuss the new Wellness Center project that we're aiming to launch by Q2 next year. As part of Merck's initiative to enhance employee well-being, we're looking to create a space that not only supports occupational therapy but also fosters a calming and restorative environment for all employees.

Given your expertise in interior and spatial design, I believe your input will be invaluable in creating a functional and aesthetically pleasing space. I'd love to set up a meeting next week to brainstorm ideas and go over some initial concepts. Are you available for a call on Tuesday, October 10th, at 2 PM?

Let me know what works best for you, and if there's anything specific you'd like to discuss beforehand. Looking forward to collaborating with you on this exciting project!

Best regards,

Hi Tabitha,

Thank you for reaching out! I'm thrilled to hear about the Wellness Center initiative. Creating a space that enhances well-being aligns perfectly with our commitment to employee health at Merck.

Tuesday, October 10th, at 2 PM works perfectly for me. I'll prepare some initial design concepts and material samples that might align with a therapeutic atmosphere. Additionally, if you have any specific requirements or preferences from an occupational therapy perspective, feel free to send them my way before our meeting.

Looking forward to our collaboration and creating something truly beneficial for our colleagues.

Best,
