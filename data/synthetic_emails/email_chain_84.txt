Hi Sonya,

I hope this message finds you well. As you know, we're gearing up for our upcoming pharmaceutical innovations exhibit scheduled for December 5th at the Princeton office. 

We're expecting a larger turnout than last year, with several interactive digital installations planned. I wanted to touch base regarding the network infrastructure required to support these installations. The last thing we want is any connectivity hiccups during the live demonstrations.

Could you review the current network capacity and let me know if we need any enhancements or temporary setups? We should also consider the security protocols given the sensitive nature of the data involved. 

Let me know a convenient time to discuss this in detail. You can reach me at (609) 555-0123.

Thanks for your support on this!

Best,  
Marc Duran

Hi Marc,

Thanks for reaching out and for the heads-up about the exhibit. It sounds like an exciting event, and I agree that ensuring robust network support is crucial.

I'll review the current network specs and assess what upgrades might be necessary to handle the increased load, especially with the interactive installations you mentioned. I'll also loop in our security team to ensure that our data protection measures are up to par.

How about we schedule a meeting this Thursday at 3 PM to go over everything? Let me know if that works for you. If not, I'm flexible to find another time before I head out on vacation next week.

Looking forward to collaborating on this!

Best regards,
