**Subject:** Q4 Budget Revisions and Upcoming Financial Review  

Hi Brandy,

Hope your week is off to a great start. As we're gearing up for the Q4 financial review, I wanted to touch base regarding the recent budget revisions for the oncology R&D projects. We need to align our figures before the meeting with the executive board on October 25th.

I've noticed some discrepancies in the projected expenditures for the new immunotherapy trials. Could you provide a detailed breakdown of the allocations? It seems like our initial estimates have been adjusted, and I'd like to ensure everything aligns with our financial targets.

Additionally, could we schedule a time this week to discuss the capital allocations for the upcoming fiscal year? I'm available most afternoons, but Thursday would be ideal since I'll be in the Rahway office. Let me know your availability.

Thanks,
Bryce

Hi Bryce,

Thanks for reaching out. I've reviewed the oncology R&D budget, and it appears that the adjustments were made to accommodate the unexpected increase in clinical trial costs due to the expanded patient recruitment phase. I'll send over a detailed breakdown by end of day today.

As for the capital allocations discussion, I'm available Thursday afternoon. How about we meet at 2 PM in Conference Room B? We can also loop in the project leads to provide insights on their respective budgets for 2024.

Looking forward to our meeting, and please let me know if there's anything else you'd like me to prepare in advance.

Best,  
Brandy
