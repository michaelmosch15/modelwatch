Hi Gilbert,

I hope this email finds you well. As we’re gearing up for the launch of the Military Wellness Program next month, I wanted to touch base with you regarding the logistics support for the sports and physical activity components of the program. 

Given your expertise in sports administration, your insights will be invaluable in tailoring these activities to better suit the needs of our service members. Could we set up a meeting this week to discuss the framework and logistics? I am available on Wednesday and Friday after 2 PM, or we can arrange a time that works best for you.

Additionally, I will be on leave from October 23rd to 27th, so it would be great if we can finalize the initial plans before then. Let me know your availability.

Best regards,  
Michelle Morgan

Hi Michelle,

Thanks for reaching out. I agree that getting the logistics right is crucial for the success of the Military Wellness Program. Wednesday at 3 PM works perfectly for me to discuss the framework and logistics. We can meet in Conference Room B on the 3rd floor of the West Wing.

Also, I’ll prepare a draft outline of the sports activities we’ve proposed and bring it along for our meeting. This should give us a good starting point to tailor our offerings to the specific needs of the participants.

Enjoy your upcoming leave! Let’s aim to have a solid plan in place before you head out. Looking forward to our discussion.

Best,  
Gilbert Mayer
