**Subject:** Upcoming Video Project Planning Session  

Hi Erika,

I hope this message finds you well. I wanted to touch base regarding the upcoming video project on the new cardiovascular drug launch. We’ll need to start mapping out the production timeline and key deliverables.

Could you please coordinate a planning session with the team for next Wednesday, October 18th? Let’s aim for 10:00 AM in Conference Room B. Make sure to include the storyboard drafts and any preliminary footage samples we have. I’ll be bringing our latest script revisions for review.

Also, please ensure the equipment checklist is updated so we can avoid any last-minute hiccups. Let me know if you need any specific resources or if there are any scheduling conflicts.

Thanks for your hard work on this. Let’s aim to make this a seamless rollout. Feel free to reach me on my cell if anything urgent comes up: (555) 876-2345.

Best,  
Shaun

Hi Shaun,

Thanks for the heads-up. I’ll get the ball rolling on setting up the planning session for October 18th. I’ll send out invites to the team today and ensure that Conference Room B is booked. I’m confirming with IT that all equipment will be available and functional. I’ll also follow up with the creative team to gather any additional materials we might need.

I’ll make sure to have the updated equipment checklist ready for you by the end of this week. If there’s anything else you think we should focus on, just let me know.

Looking forward to collaborating on this project. Please feel free to email or call if there’s anything else you need.

Best regards,  
Erika
