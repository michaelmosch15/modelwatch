Hi Virginia,

I hope this message finds you well. I'm reaching out to discuss our upcoming Wellness Seminar scheduled for November 15th. As you know, we’re looking to spotlight Merck’s latest advancements in physiotherapy treatments and how they align with our broader health initiatives.

Given your expertise in public relations, I believe your insights would be invaluable in shaping our narrative and ensuring we effectively communicate the benefits of our innovations to both healthcare professionals and the general public.

Could we schedule a time to discuss this in more detail? I'm available for a call or meeting either Thursday or Friday morning this week. Let me know what works best for you.

Looking forward to your input.

Best regards,

Hi Abigail,

Thank you for reaching out! I'm excited about the Wellness Seminar and the opportunity to highlight Merck's contributions to improved patient outcomes. I completely agree that aligning our message with the latest advancements in physiotherapy will be beneficial.

I can definitely meet on Thursday morning. How does 10:00 AM sound? If it’s convenient for you, we could meet at the collaborative space on the 8th floor. We can go over the key messages and identify the best channels to reach our target audience.

Let me know if this works for you or if there’s another time that’s more suitable.

Looking forward to our collaboration.

Warm regards,
