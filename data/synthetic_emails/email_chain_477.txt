Hi Sylvia,

I hope this message finds you well. As you know, Merck is committed to promoting health and wellness across various sectors. I am reaching out to explore a potential collaboration between our departments for the upcoming Health Awareness Week in November.

Given your expertise in sports coaching, I believe we could develop an engaging program that combines physical activity with educational workshops on maintaining a healthy lifestyle. This can serve both our employees and the community, aligning with Merck's mission to enhance wellbeing.

Could we schedule a meeting to brainstorm some ideas? I am available this week on Wednesday and Thursday post 2 PM. Let me know what works for you.

Looking forward to your thoughts.

Best regards,

Hi Willie,

Thank you for reaching out and considering me for this initiative. The idea sounds fantastic, and I agree that merging educational and physical activities could have a powerful impact. I'm excited about the potential of creating a dynamic program for both employees and the surrounding community.

Wednesday at 3 PM works perfectly for me. Let's meet in Conference Room B on the second floor. I’ll bring along some preliminary thoughts on integrating sports and wellness strategies, and I’d love to hear your insights from the educational perspective.

Also, as a heads up, I'll be out of office from October 20-27 for a family commitment, so I’d like to get as much planned before then.

Looking forward to our discussion.

Best,
