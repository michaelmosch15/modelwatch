Hi Gregg,

I hope this message finds you well. I'm reaching out to discuss a potential collaboration between our teams that could enhance our mental health support materials for the prison and probation services sector. Given Merck's ongoing commitment to mental health, I believe we have a unique opportunity to develop resources that could make a significant impact.

I recently reviewed the draft of our latest psychological assessment toolkit, and I think there's room to incorporate more evidence-based approaches, possibly drawing from recent studies or expert insights. I recall you mentioning an interest in expanding our editorial scope in your last quarterly update, so I thought this might align well with your objectives.

Could we schedule a time to discuss this in more detail? I'm available for a call on Thursday or Friday afternoon this week. Please let me know what works best for you.

Looking forward to hearing your thoughts.

Best regards,

Hi Manuel,

Thanks for reaching out. I'm very interested in exploring how we can enhance our mental health materials, particularly with the integration of new research and methodologies. Your toolkit sounds promising, and I agree that aligning our editorial scope with evidence-based practices would be highly beneficial.

Thursday afternoon works for me. How about we set up a call at 3 PM? I can set up a meeting link for us. Let me know if this time suits you, and I will send over the invite.

Additionally, I'm planning to take some time off starting October 20th, so if possible, it would be great to finalize our approach before then. Let's aim to have a solid draft ready for review by the end of next week.

Looking forward to our collaboration.

Best,
