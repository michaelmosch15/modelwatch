Hi Travis,

I hope this message finds you well. I am reaching out to discuss the potential collaboration on your upcoming article about holistic wellness practices within the pharmaceutical industry. Given my background at Merck and our recent initiatives integrating chiropractic care with traditional medicine, I believe we could provide some valuable insights.

We've been seeing promising results from our latest patient-centered care program, and I think our approach could add a unique angle to your piece. If you are available, I'd love to set up a time to chat further about this. I’m available this week on Wednesday after 3 PM or Thursday morning.

Looking forward to hearing from you.

Best,

Hi Bianca,

Thanks for reaching out! Your experience with Merck’s new initiatives sounds like a perfect fit for the article. I am particularly interested in how integrating chiropractic care has been received by patients and healthcare providers alike.

I’m free to meet on Wednesday at 4 PM. Let’s discuss how we can highlight the innovative steps Merck is taking in the wellness sector. I’ll be working from the downtown office, so we can do a video call if that works for you.

Also, please feel free to share any preliminary data or case studies that you think might be beneficial to include in the article. I’m excited to collaborate on this.

Best regards,

Morning Travis,

Wednesday at 4 PM works perfectly for me. I'll send you a Teams invite for our video call. I'll prepare some preliminary data and case studies from our patient-centered care program to discuss.

Looking forward to our conversation and exploring how we can showcase Merck’s contributions to holistic wellness in your article.

See you tomorrow!

Best,
