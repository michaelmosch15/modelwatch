Hi Ross,

I hope this message finds you well. I am reaching out regarding the upcoming site visit to our R&D facility in Rahway. As part of the logistics team, I’ll be assisting with the coordination of travel arrangements for the survey team.

Could you provide me with the list of surveyors attending and any specific requirements or preferences they may have? This will help us ensure that everyone is accommodated comfortably. Also, do you have a tentative schedule for the on-site evaluations? Knowing this will help us align the transportation and lodging logistics more efficiently.

Please let me know if there’s anything specific you need from my end before the visit. You can reach me at (555) 789-4561 or drop by my office on the 4th floor near the HR department.

Looking forward to your response.

Best,

Hi Dawn,

Thanks for getting in touch. I’ve attached the list of surveyors who will be attending the site visit, along with their preferences for travel and accommodation. As of now, we plan to conduct evaluations from November 5th to 7th, with a focus on the integration of the new lab equipment into the existing infrastructure.

We’ll need transportation arranged from Newark Liberty International Airport to the facility and back, as well as hotel accommodations nearby. Please ensure that the accommodations have reliable internet connectivity, as we’ll be uploading data to our servers throughout the evaluations.

Let me know if there are any issues or further details required. I’ll be available on my cell at (555) 123-9876 if you need immediate assistance.

Thanks for coordinating this. It’s great to know we have your support in making this site visit seamless.

Best regards,  
Ross Henry
