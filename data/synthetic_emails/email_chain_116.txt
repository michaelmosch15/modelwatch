Hi Shelly,

I hope this message finds you well. I wanted to touch base regarding the recent expenses submitted for the Armed Forces Training and Education Program. As we approach the end of Q4, it's crucial that we ensure all expenses align with our budgetary allocations.

In particular, I noticed a few entries related to venue bookings and catering that are slightly above our projected estimates. Could you provide some context or supporting documentation for these items? It would be helpful to understand whether these were one-time exceptions due to special circumstances.

Additionally, I will be on leave from October 20th to October 27th. If we could sort this out by the 19th, that would ensure a smooth handover to the interim team. Feel free to call me directly at (555) 342-8976 if you need a quick discussion.

Looking forward to your insights.

Best,  
Jocelyn Winters

Hi Jocelyn,

Thanks for your email. I appreciate the heads-up as we finalize our Q4 reports. Regarding the venue bookings and catering, these were indeed exceptions. We hosted a joint training session with the Department of Defense, which required a larger venue and additional security measures, hence the increased costs. I’ll forward the detailed invoices and approval documents to you by the end of the day.

Let me know if there’s anything else you need before your leave. I’ll make sure to address any outstanding issues before the 19th. Enjoy your well-deserved break!

Best regards,
