Hi Kristin,

I hope this message finds you well. I'm reaching out to discuss a potential collaboration on our upcoming Community Health Outreach Initiative scheduled for November 15th. As part of Merck's commitment to improving public health literacy, we are looking to integrate a sports and wellness component into our program at the local libraries.

Given your expertise in sports development, I believe your insights could be invaluable in shaping activities that engage the community, especially younger demographics. We are considering workshops that focus on the importance of physical activity in maintaining overall health, which aligns well with our ongoing pharmaceutical campaigns to reduce chronic diseases like diabetes and hypertension.

Could we set up a time next week to brainstorm some ideas? I'm available on Tuesday and Thursday afternoons. Let me know what works best for you.

Looking forward to your thoughts.

Best,

Hi Brandon,

Thank you for reaching out. I’m thrilled about the opportunity to collaborate on the Community Health Outreach Initiative. Integrating sports into our health literacy efforts could significantly enhance the impact of our programs.

I agree that workshops focusing on physical activity could be a great addition. We could also consider developing a mini sports clinic to demonstrate practical exercises that participants can incorporate into their daily routines. I have some preliminary ideas that could align with the themes of our current "Active Life" campaign.

Next Tuesday afternoon works for me. How about we meet at the North Office conference room at 2 PM? Let me know if this suits your schedule.

Looking forward to working together on this exciting project.
