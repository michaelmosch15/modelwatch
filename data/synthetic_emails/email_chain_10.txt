Hi Kathryn,

I hope this message finds you well. I’m reaching out to discuss the new pediatric formulation project we’re embarking on. As you know, this initiative is crucial for addressing the specific needs of our younger patients and ensuring their safety and comfort with our products.

Given your expertise in materials engineering, I believe your insights into the formulation's delivery system will be invaluable. We’re particularly interested in exploring how different materials can affect the absorption and efficacy of the medication in children.

Could we schedule a time to discuss this further? I’m available for a call or a meeting later this week. Let me know what works best for you.

Looking forward to your thoughts.

Best regards,

Hi Susan,

Thank you for reaching out. I’m excited about the pediatric formulation project and the opportunity to collaborate with you and your team. Understanding the unique challenges of pediatric patients is vital, and I’m eager to see how we can innovate in this area.

Regarding scheduling, I’m available this Thursday, October 12, after 2 PM. We could meet in the main conference room on the 3rd floor or have a video call if that’s more convenient for you. Once we finalize the time, I'll ensure to have some preliminary data on material interactions ready for our discussion.

Also, just a heads-up, I'll be on leave from October 20-27, so I’d like to ensure we make significant progress before then.

Looking forward to working together on this exciting project.

Best,
