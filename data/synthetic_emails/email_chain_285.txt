Hi Isaac,

I hope this message finds you well. As you know, we're gearing up for the rollout of the new Learning Management System (LMS) next quarter. As part of this initiative, I wanted to touch base regarding the training session scheduled for October 25th at the Kenilworth office.

Your role as a runner is crucial in ensuring that all video content is properly aligned and accessible for our team members. We'll need your expertise in coordinating with the broadcasting team to ensure that the filming and editing schedule aligns with the training timelines. Could you confirm your availability for a brief meeting this Thursday at 2 PM to discuss the specifics?

Additionally, if you have any insights or suggestions from the recent project with the Oncology team, I'd appreciate hearing them. Your perspective on how we might streamline the video production process for this session would be invaluable.

Looking forward to your response.

Best regards,

Hi Jasmine,

Thanks for reaching out. I'm available this Thursday at 2 PM and look forward to discussing the LMS training session specifics. Ensuring that the video content is top-notch and delivered on time is a priority, and I'll coordinate with the broadcasting team to streamline our workflow.

Regarding the Oncology project, I noticed that simplifying the script and having a concise storyboard significantly improved our turnaround time. I suggest implementing a similar approach for the LMS video content. I'll bring some detailed notes on this to our meeting.

Please let me know if there’s anything else you’d like me to prepare ahead of time. Also, just a heads up—I’ll be out of the office from November 1st to the 5th for a short break, so let's aim to finalize everything before then.

Looking forward to working closely on this.

Best,
