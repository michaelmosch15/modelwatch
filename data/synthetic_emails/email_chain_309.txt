Hi Kurt,

I hope this message finds you well. As you are aware, we have the upcoming compliance audit scheduled for November 5th at our Kenilworth office. Given the recent updates in our civil service protocols, we need to ensure that all documentation aligns with the latest industry regulations.

Could you please review the preliminary compliance checklist that was circulated last week? There are a few sections, particularly around patent law and international trade compliance, that could use your expertise. Your insights would be invaluable to ensure that we don't overlook any critical elements.

If possible, could we aim to have a draft report ready by October 27th? This would give us ample time to address any gaps before the audit. Please let me know if you need any additional resources or support from my team.

Looking forward to your feedback.

Best,

Hi Kyle,

Thank you for reaching out. I have already started reviewing the compliance checklist and I agree, the sections on patent law and international trade compliance could use some refinement. I will make sure to focus on those areas in detail.

Regarding the draft report, I should be able to have a comprehensive review completed by October 25th, giving us a few extra days to refine any sections as needed. I’ll send you my preliminary findings by early next week.

If you have any specific points of concern or additional documentation that you think might be relevant, please feel free to send them my way. I'm confident we can ensure everything is in top shape before the audit.

Let's touch base later this week – perhaps Friday? I’m available for a call or a quick meeting in the afternoon. Just let me know what works for you.

Best regards,
