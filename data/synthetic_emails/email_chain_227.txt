Hi Francisco,

I hope this email finds you well. As part of our ongoing efforts to promote health and wellness within our communities, I wanted to discuss potential collaborations between our departments, specifically focusing on health tourism initiatives that align with sports and fitness programs.

Given Merck's commitment to holistic health, I believe there is an opportunity to develop a series of events or workshops that integrate our pharmaceutical expertise with active lifestyle promotion. Perhaps we could look into organizing a "Wellness Weekend" where participants can engage in sports activities while learning about our latest wellness products.

Could we schedule a time this week to brainstorm ideas? I'm available Thursday and Friday after 2 PM. Also, let me know if you have any specific projects that could dovetail with this initiative.

Looking forward to your thoughts.

Best,

Hi Shawn,

Thanks for reaching out. I think your idea for a "Wellness Weekend" is fantastic and could definitely align with our current "Fit for Life" program. We are always looking for innovative ways to engage the community and emphasize the importance of an active lifestyle in disease prevention and overall well-being.

I’d be happy to meet later this week to discuss this further. How about we set up a meeting on Thursday at 3 PM? We can meet in my office on the fourth floor, Room 412. I’ll make sure to bring our latest metrics and feedback from recent sports events to see how they can be integrated into your proposal.

Looking forward to our collaboration.

Best regards,

Hi Francisco,

Thursday at 3 PM works perfectly. I'll bring along some data on health tourism trends that could complement the sports metrics you mentioned. I'm excited about the potential impact we could have together!

See you then.

Warm regards,
