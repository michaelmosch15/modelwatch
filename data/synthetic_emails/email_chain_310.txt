Subject: Coordination for Upcoming Event at the Research Facility

Hi Geoffrey,

I hope this message finds you well. I'm reaching out to discuss the logistics for the upcoming event at the Rahway Research Facility on November 10th. As you know, we're expecting a delegation of international visitors interested in our latest advancements in oncology research.

Given the high profile of our guests, we want to ensure that everything runs smoothly, particularly concerning catering. Could you please provide an update on the menu options you are considering? We need to accommodate a few dietary restrictions, including vegetarian and gluten-free preferences.

Additionally, I’d like to schedule a walkthrough of the event space next week to finalize arrangements. Please let me know your availability. You can reach me at my direct line, (555) 123-4567, if that's more convenient.

Looking forward to your input.

Best regards,

Claudia Vazquez

Hi Claudia,

Thanks for reaching out. I'm glad to assist with the coordination for the event. We have a few menu options lined up, focusing on a fusion of continental and local cuisines, ensuring we can cater to a range of dietary needs. I'll send over a detailed menu proposal by tomorrow for your review.

Regarding the walkthrough, I'm available on Wednesday, October 18th, around 2 PM. Let me know if this works for you, or suggest another time. It's crucial we align on the setup to ensure a seamless experience for our guests.

Feel free to call my cell at (555) 987-6543 if any urgent issues arise or if you have additional requirements.
