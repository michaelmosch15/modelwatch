Hi Kent,

I hope this email finds you well. I'm reaching out to discuss the upcoming safety evaluation for the new plant-based compound that your team has been developing. As you know, ensuring fire safety protocols are adhered to during the testing phase is crucial, especially given the volatile nature of some of the herbal extracts involved.

Could we schedule a time this week to walk through the lab and discuss any potential hazards? I’d like to make sure we’re covering all bases to prevent any incidents. I’m available Wednesday and Thursday between 10 AM and 2 PM. Let me know what works best for you.

Additionally, I’ll be on leave starting next Friday for a week, so I want to ensure everything is in place before then.

Looking forward to your reply.

Best,

Hi Jacob,

Thanks for reaching out. I agree that it's essential to review the safety aspects of the new compound, especially considering the unique properties of the herbal extracts we're working with. I can meet on Wednesday at 11 AM. We can walk through the lab facilities and go over the safety protocols.

We’ve been making significant progress on the compound, and I’m excited about its potential. Your insight will be invaluable to ensure we're all set from a safety perspective.

Enjoy your upcoming leave! Let’s make sure everything is in order before you go.
