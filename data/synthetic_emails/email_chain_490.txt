Subject: Review of Illustrations for Upcoming Publication  

Hi Alexis,

I hope this email finds you well. I wanted to touch base regarding the illustrations for the upcoming publication on our new immunotherapy drug, which is scheduled for release next month.

The editorial team is currently reviewing all content, and they’ve emphasized the importance of ensuring that all medical illustrations are not only accurate but also align with the latest Merck branding guidelines. Could you please prioritize a review of the images and update any that might need modifications? It would be great if you can have this done by October 25th, so we have ample time for any further revisions.

Also, just a heads up, I’ll be on leave from November 6th to 10th. If there are any urgent updates needed during that time, please reach out to Mark in my absence. His email is mark.jones@merck.com.

Feel free to give me a call at my direct line if you have any questions or need further clarification. My number is (908) 555-0143.

Thanks for your cooperation on this one!

Best,  
Jo Franklin

Hi Jo,

Thanks for reaching out. I’ve already started reviewing the illustrations and should have the updates ready by the deadline you mentioned. I’ll ensure that the visuals adhere to the latest branding guidelines and are scientifically accurate.

I appreciate the heads up about your leave. I’ll make sure to finalize everything before you’re out. If something comes up, I’ll coordinate with Mark as suggested.

I’ll keep you posted on my progress. If you have any specific feedback from the editorial team regarding the illustrations, please send it my way.

Best regards,
