**Subject:** Follow-up on Investment Insights for the New Oncology Programme

Hi Charlotte,

I hope this message finds you well. I wanted to touch base regarding the investment insights you provided last month for our new oncology programme. Your expertise has been incredibly valuable in shaping our strategic approach, particularly your analysis on the emerging market trends.

We are now in the process of finalizing our financial projections and I was wondering if you could take another look at the revised figures. Your input would be crucial in presenting a comprehensive proposal to the board next week.

Let me know your availability this week to discuss this further. I’m generally free on Wednesday and Friday afternoons. 

Looking forward to your thoughts.

Best,

Hi Sabrina,

Thank you for reaching out. I'm glad to hear that my previous insights have been beneficial. I'd be happy to review the updated financial projections. Let's aim for a meeting on Wednesday afternoon; I am available after 3 PM. 

Please send me the revised documents ahead of our meeting so I can prepare any additional analysis you might need. Also, I’ll be on leave starting next Thursday, attending a conference in Geneva, so it would be great to finalize everything before then.

Feel free to drop by my office on the 12th floor if you’re in the building, or we can set up a Zoom call if that’s more convenient.

Best regards,
