**Subject:** Visa Renewal Process for Upcoming Conference

Hi Tracy,

I hope this email finds you well. As you prepare for the International Homeopathy Conference in Barcelona next month, I wanted to check in regarding your visa status. Given your presentation on the integration of homeopathy in chronic disease management, it's crucial that all travel documents are in order to avoid any last-minute issues.

Could you please confirm if your current work visa covers international travel for this conference? If not, we need to expedite the renewal process. Please send me the details of your current visa at your earliest convenience, and I'll coordinate with our external immigration consultants to ensure everything is set.

Feel free to call me directly at (555) 123-4567 if you have any questions or require immediate assistance.

Looking forward to your reply.

Best,

Hi Janice,

Thank you for reaching out. I appreciate your proactive approach to getting my travel documents in order. My current visa does cover international travel, but it is set to expire at the end of this month. I'll send you a scanned copy by the end of today, so you have the necessary details.

The conference is scheduled for November 15th-18th, and I will be presenting on the second day. It's a fantastic opportunity to showcase our latest findings on homeopathy applications. I would hate for any logistical issues to interfere, so thank you for handling this.

Let me know if there's anything else you need from my end.

Best regards,
