Subject: Trademark Approval Needed for New Campaign

Hi Hayden,

I hope this message finds you well. I am reaching out regarding the new advertising campaign for our upcoming product launch. I understand you’ve been working closely with the creative team to finalize the visuals.

Before we proceed, I need to ensure that all trademarks and brand elements used in the campaign materials comply with our legal standards. Could you please share the latest draft of the designs and any specific brand names or logos you plan to feature?

Also, if there are any new taglines or phrases, I’ll need to review those for trademark clearance as well. Given the timeline, it would be great if you could send these over by the end of the week, October 13. This will allow us enough time to address any potential issues.

Thank you, and feel free to call me at (555) 0192-6734 if you have any questions.

Best regards,

Sophia Wiggins

Hi Sophia,

Thanks for getting in touch. I’m glad you reached out before we move too far ahead. I've attached the latest drafts of our visuals. We’re using a couple of new taglines and a redesigned logo that incorporates elements from our existing brand identity.

Please let me know if there are any issues or if you need additional information. I’m aiming to have everything finalized by next Friday, October 20, so your input before then would be invaluable.

I’ll be out of the office on Monday for a family commitment but will be available via email or phone if anything urgent comes up.

Looking forward to your feedback.

Best,
