Hi Jaime,

I hope this message finds you well. I'm reaching out to discuss the integration of our latest speech therapy devices in the new healthcare facilities your team is working on. As you know, these devices are crucial for providing top-notch patient care, and timely installation is essential for our upcoming project milestones.

Could we schedule a meeting to discuss the specifications and any potential modifications to the facility layouts that might be required? I understand you’re coordinating with several teams, so I’d like to ensure our requirements are aligned with the overall project timeline. Please let me know your availability this week.

Also, just a heads-up, I’ll be on leave from October 16th to 20th, so it would be great to get this sorted before then.

Looking forward to your response.

Best regards,

Hi Mandy,

Thanks for reaching out. It's great to hear that the new devices are ready for integration. Let's aim to have a meeting this Friday, October 8th, at 2 PM. We can use the conference room on the 5th floor; it should be quiet enough for us to discuss in detail. I'll arrange for the relevant team members to join us so we can address any technical adjustments needed for the device installations.

Regarding your upcoming leave, I'll make sure we have everything finalized before then. If there's anything specific you need from my side before our meeting, just let me know.

Best,
