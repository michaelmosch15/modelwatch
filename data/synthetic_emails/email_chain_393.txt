**Subject:** Request for Video Assets for Upcoming Presentation

Hi Daryl,

I hope this message finds you well. I’m reaching out regarding the upcoming presentation for the Annual Defense Health Agency Symposium scheduled for November 10th. As you know, Merck is presenting on our latest innovations in military medical solutions, particularly developments in rapid-response vaccine deployments.

Could you please prepare a video segment highlighting our recent projects in collaboration with the Defense Department? We’re looking for a 3-5 minute clip that effectively showcases our cutting-edge research and its impact on operational readiness. Particularly, we want to include our work with the CBRN (Chemical, Biological, Radiological, and Nuclear defense) units.

Let me know if you need any additional data or footage from our side. I’m attaching the latest project summaries for your reference. The deadline for the draft is October 27th to ensure we have ample time for revisions.

Thanks for your expertise on this!

Best,

Hi Herbert,

Thanks for reaching out. I’m on board with creating the video for the symposium. The project summaries you attached will be a great starting point. I’ll begin compiling clips from our existing footage and look into any new material that might enhance the narrative.

Do you have any specific testimonials or sound bites from the field that you would like included? Those could really enrich the presentation, especially if we have endorsements from high-ranking officials.

Also, just a quick heads-up, I’ll be on leave from October 30th to November 3rd. So, I’ll aim to send you a draft by October 25th to allow some buffer for any last-minute changes before my leave.

Feel free to drop by my office at 2E-14 if you want to discuss this in more detail. Let’s make this presentation impactful!

Best regards,
