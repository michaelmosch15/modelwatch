Hi Melinda,

I hope this email finds you well. I’m reaching out to discuss an exciting opportunity for collaboration. As part of our upcoming quarterly issue of Pharma Insights Magazine, we are focusing on sustainable infrastructure within the pharmaceutical sector, and I believe your expertise in civil engineering, particularly in consulting, would be invaluable.

Could we schedule a time to discuss potential angles for the article? I’m particularly interested in exploring how Merck is integrating sustainable practices in our facilities and the role that engineering plays in these innovations. If you’re available, I’d love to set up a meeting next week. Just let me know a time that works for you.

Looking forward to your insights.

Best,

Hi Zoe,

Thank you for reaching out. I’m thrilled about the opportunity to contribute to Pharma Insights Magazine. Sustainable infrastructure is a topic I’m passionate about, especially within the context of our industry.

I’m available for a meeting on October 17th at 2 PM. Would that work for you? We can discuss the ongoing projects at our Rahway site, where we’ve recently implemented several eco-friendly engineering solutions. I think these could provide a compelling narrative for your article.

Let me know if this time suits you, or if there’s an alternative that might be better. Also, just to give you a heads-up, I’ll be on leave from October 25th, so it would be great to finalize our discussion before then.

Looking forward to our collaboration.

Best regards,
