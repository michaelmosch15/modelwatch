Hi Dorothy,

I hope this message finds you well. As we gear up for the next phase of Project Horizon, I wanted to touch base regarding our mineral sourcing analysis. Given your expertise in market trends and economic impacts, I believe your insights will be invaluable as we assess the viability and cost-effectiveness of potential suppliers.

I've compiled some preliminary data on lithium and cobalt suppliers, focusing on both cost and sustainability metrics. Would you be available for a meeting next Tuesday, October 17, at 2 PM to discuss this further? We can meet in Conference Room B on the 5th floor. I believe this collaboration will significantly enhance our procurement strategy and align with Merck's sustainability goals.

Let me know if this time works for you, or suggest another time if it's more convenient.

Best regards,

Hi Cynthia,

Thanks for reaching out. I'm glad to hear about the progress on Project Horizon. I'm definitely interested in contributing to the analysis, and I agree that a comprehensive review of our suppliers will be crucial.

Tuesday at 2 PM works perfectly for me. I'll prepare some recent economic reports on the global lithium and cobalt markets, as well as forecasts that might influence our decision-making. Let's aim to outline a framework that can guide our procurement team towards more sustainable and cost-effective choices.

Looking forward to our discussion. Please let me know if there are any specific aspects you want me to focus on before our meeting.

Best,

P.S. I'll be out of the office for a few days starting October 20, so if we need to follow up, it might be best to do so before then.
