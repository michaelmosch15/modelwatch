Subject: Collaboration on Upcoming Exhibition Project

Hi Terrance,

I hope this email finds you well. I'm reaching out to discuss the upcoming exhibition project we have scheduled for the next quarter. As you know, this will be a significant opportunity to showcase our latest advancements in vaccine development and highlight Merck's commitment to innovation in pharmaceuticals.

I've been working on the educational content for the interactive displays and would love your insights on how we can best integrate these into the exhibition design. Your expertise in creating engaging and informative environments would be invaluable to ensure the content resonates with our audience.

Could we set up a meeting to brainstorm some ideas? I'm available this Thursday or Friday afternoon. Please let me know what works for you, or feel free to suggest another time.

Looking forward to your thoughts.

Best regards,

Hi Sergio,

Thanks for reaching out. I'm excited about the upcoming exhibition and the opportunity to partner with you on this project. Integrating dynamic educational content is crucial, and I think we can create something truly impactful.

Thursday afternoon works perfectly for me. Let's meet at 2 PM in the design office on the 3rd floor. We can go over the preliminary concepts and discuss how we can incorporate your educational elements into the visual layout.

Also, just a heads up, I'll be on leave from November 10th to 15th, so let's make sure we iron out the details before then to keep the project timeline on track.

Looking forward to our meeting.

Best,
