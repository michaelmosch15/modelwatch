Subject: Review of Q3 Tax Compliance Report

Hi Janice,

I hope this message finds you well. As we wrap up the third quarter, I wanted to reach out to discuss our upcoming tax compliance review. I've attached the preliminary Q3 Tax Compliance Report for your assessment.

Can you please review the document and let me know if there are any concerns or areas that need further clarification? Given the recent changes in the tax regulations, particularly in our European markets, I want to ensure we are fully aligned and compliant before our submission deadline on October 25th.

Additionally, I wanted to mention that I'll be on leave from October 18th to 22nd. If there are any urgent matters during that time, please feel free to reach out to my colleague, Lisa Tran, at ltran@example.net or call her at (555) 019-3827.

Looking forward to your feedback.

Best regards,

Hi Duane,

Thank you for sending over the Q3 report. I've skimmed through it, and everything seems to align with the recent directives, except for a minor discrepancy in the VAT calculations for our German operations. I'll send you the detailed notes by tomorrow.

Regarding your upcoming leave, I'll make sure to reach out to Lisa if anything urgent comes up. Let's aim to have a quick meeting this Friday to go over the VAT issue and finalize our strategy for the submission. Would 2 PM work for you?

Also, I wanted to say congratulations on your recent presentation at the Global Pharma Finance Summit. I heard it was a great success!

Looking forward to our collaboration on this.

Best,
