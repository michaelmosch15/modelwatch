Hi Luke,

I hope this email finds you well. I wanted to touch base regarding our ongoing efforts to develop integrated care strategies for pediatric patients at Merck. Given your expertise in childhood psychotherapy, I believe your insights could greatly enhance the program's effectiveness, especially in the context of our new initiative targeting sports injuries in young athletes.

I propose we set up a meeting to brainstorm how we can integrate mental health support into our existing therapy protocols. I have some preliminary ideas, but I would love to hear your thoughts as well. Are you available for a call this Thursday at 2 PM? If that doesn't work, please let me know a time that suits you better.

Looking forward to collaborating further.

Best regards,

Hi Mercedes,

Great to hear from you. I'm enthusiastic about the prospect of integrating psychotherapy into our pediatric sports therapy protocols. It's essential that we address the psychological aspects of recovery for young athletes, as they can significantly impact both rehabilitation outcomes and overall well-being.

Thursday at 2 PM works perfectly for me. Let's meet in the conference room on the 5th floor - it's usually quiet at that time. I’ll prepare some case studies that highlight common psychological challenges faced by children recovering from sports injuries, which might give us a good starting point for the discussion.

See you then!

Best,

P.S. I’ll be out of the office next Friday for a family commitment, but will be reachable via email if anything urgent arises.
