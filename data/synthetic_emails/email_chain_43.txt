**Subject:** Collaboration for Upcoming Employee Engagement Event  

Hi Elijah,

I hope this message finds you well. I'm reaching out to discuss the upcoming employee engagement event scheduled for November 15th at our Rahway campus. We are aiming to create a vibrant and interactive atmosphere, and I believe your expertise as a musician could significantly enhance the event experience.

Given your previous work on the "Harmony in Health" campaign, I think incorporating a live music element could be a great addition. We’re envisioning something that aligns with our "Innovation in Wellness" theme, and I would love to get your thoughts on potential setlists or interactive music sessions that could engage our team members effectively.

Could we set up a time to discuss this further? I am available for a call or meeting this Thursday or Friday afternoon, whichever suits your schedule best. Please let me know your availability.

Looking forward to your creative insights!

Best,

Hi Jillian,

Thanks for reaching out! I'm excited about the opportunity to collaborate on the employee engagement event at Rahway. The "Innovation in Wellness" theme aligns perfectly with some of the projects I've been working on, specifically the "Sound of Science" initiative, which focuses on the intersection of music and wellness.

For the setlist, I think we can incorporate both energetic and soothing pieces to cater to different parts of the event, perhaps starting with something lively to kick things off and then transitioning to more relaxed tunes as the day progresses. Additionally, I can organize an interactive drumming session that has been well-received in past events.

I'm available for a call this Thursday at 3 PM. Let me know if that works for you, or if there's another time that might be better. Looking forward to brainstorming and making this event a memorable one for everyone involved!

Best regards,
