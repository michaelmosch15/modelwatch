Hi Elizabeth,

I hope this message finds you well. I'm reaching out to discuss our ongoing initiative on sustainable mineral sourcing for Merck's pharmaceutical production lines, particularly focusing on our operations in the Democratic Republic of the Congo. As you know, ensuring ethical and sustainable practices in our supply chain is a top priority.

I've been conducting surveys in the region to assess current mining practices, and I'm compiling a report that highlights both opportunities and challenges. Your expertise in international aid and development work could provide valuable insights into community engagement strategies and how we can align our sourcing with broader developmental goals.

Could you let me know your availability for a call next week? I believe a collaborative approach could significantly enhance the impact of our project. Also, if there's any preliminary data or reports from your recent fieldwork that you could share, it would be greatly appreciated.

Looking forward to your input.

Best,

Hi Marvin,

Thank you for reaching out and for the important work you're doing. I completely agree that a collaborative approach is essential for the success of our sustainable sourcing initiatives.

I have some insights from our recent projects on developing community infrastructure that might be relevant. I'll be happy to share these during our discussion. Next week, I am available on Tuesday and Thursday afternoons. Let me know what works best for you, and we can set up a meeting accordingly.

Also, please note that I’ll be on leave starting October 20th for two weeks, but I'll ensure all necessary details are handed over to my team before then.

Looking forward to our collaboration.

Best regards,
