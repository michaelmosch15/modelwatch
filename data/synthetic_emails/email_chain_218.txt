Hi Monique,

I hope this message finds you well. As part of our ongoing project to enhance the understanding of rare hematological conditions, I'm reaching out to leverage some of the historical medical case files that might be archived in the Heritage Department.

Given your expertise in managing Merck's historical assets, would you be able to assist in identifying any relevant documents or case studies from the past that could provide insight into the evolution of treatment protocols for conditions like aplastic anemia or hemophilia? Access to such data would be invaluable for our research team as we aim to innovate new treatment methodologies.

Could we perhaps schedule a meeting next week to discuss this further? I'm available most mornings, except for Wednesday. Please let me know what works for you.

Thanks in advance for your assistance.

Best regards,

Tammy Humphrey

Hi Tammy,

Thank you for reaching out. I'm glad to hear about the progress on your project. We do have an extensive archive of historical medical cases, and I'm confident we can find some valuable materials for your research.

Let's plan to meet on Thursday, October 12, at 10 AM in my office on the 4th floor of the Heritage Building. I'll prepare a preliminary list of documents and case files that might be of interest to your team. If there's anything specific you would like me to prioritize, please let me know.

Looking forward to our collaboration.

Best,
