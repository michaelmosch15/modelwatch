Hi Chloe,

I hope this message finds you well. I'm reaching out to discuss the upcoming research initiative focused on enhancing the efficacy of animal models in preclinical trials. Given your expertise as an animal technologist, your input would be invaluable in ensuring that our methodologies are both ethically sound and scientifically robust.

We are in the early stages of project planning and are aiming to hold an initial strategy meeting on October 12, 2023, at 10:00 AM in Conference Room B at the West Campus. Could you let me know your availability for this date?

Additionally, if you have any preliminary thoughts or resources that might be beneficial for our discussion, please feel free to share them. Your practical insights from the lab could greatly enhance our theoretical framework.

Looking forward to your reply.

Best regards,

Hi Jacqueline,

Thank you for reaching out. I'm thrilled at the opportunity to contribute to this important project. October 12 works perfectly for me, and I’ll be sure to bring some recent data from our latest trials that could provide a solid starting point for our discussions.

In preparation, I’ll also review the current protocols we have in place to identify any potential areas for improvement. Let’s aim to align our efforts with the broader objectives of Merck’s sustainability goals, particularly in reducing our environmental impact.

Please let me know if there are specific topics you would like me to focus on for the meeting. I’ll see you in Conference Room B at 10:00 AM.

Best,
