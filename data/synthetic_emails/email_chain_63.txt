Subject: Collaboration on New Training Program  

Hi Jaime,

I hope this message finds you well. I wanted to reach out regarding the development of our new training program tailored for health professionals working with individuals with learning disabilities. Given your expertise in training and education, I believe your insights could be invaluable in this initiative.

We're aiming to design a program that not only focuses on the medical aspects but also incorporates essential communication skills that can significantly benefit our team at Merck. It would be great to integrate some of the techniques used in armed forces training, as they're known for their efficiency and effectiveness.

Could we possibly schedule a meeting to discuss this further? I’m available for a virtual meeting next week, preferably on Tuesday or Thursday afternoon. Let me know what works best for your schedule.

Looking forward to your thoughts.

Best regards,

Hi Jerome,

Thanks for reaching out. I’m excited about the prospect of collaborating on this training initiative. Merging our approaches could indeed create a comprehensive program that benefits both our teams and the individuals we serve.

Tuesday afternoon works perfectly for me. How about 2 PM? We can use the company’s conference room at the South Tower office or set up a Zoom call if that’s more convenient for you. Just let me know your preference.

Also, I’ll be on leave from the 20th to the 27th of this month, so it's great we’re starting this discussion beforehand. Looking forward to brainstorming some innovative strategies together.

Best,
