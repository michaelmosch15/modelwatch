Subject: Review of Visuals for Upcoming Product Launch

Hi Kelsey,

I hope this email finds you well. I'm reaching out to share the initial drafts of the visual materials for the upcoming launch of our new pharmaceutical line, scheduled for January 2024.

Attached, you’ll find the concept designs for the promotional brochures and digital ads. I’ve incorporated the feedback from our last meeting, focusing on a clean and professional look that aligns with Merck's branding guidelines. Could you please review them and let me know if there are any adjustments needed from a content perspective?

Also, I wanted to remind you of the deadline for finalizing these materials—October 20th. This will allow us ample time for any revisions before the marketing team starts the distribution phase.

Feel free to give me a call at my office (ext. 2347) if you have any questions. Looking forward to your insights!

Best regards,  
Cathy

Hi Cathy,

Thanks for sending over the drafts. I just took a quick look, and they’re looking fantastic! I really appreciate the way you’ve highlighted the key aspects of the product with such clarity. I’ll do a detailed review by the end of the day and send you my feedback.

Regarding the deadline, I’m on it—I’ll ensure we’re on track for the October 20th timeline. Also, just a heads-up, I will be on leave from October 25th to November 1st, so let’s aim to wrap this up before then.

I’ll reach out later today if I have any immediate queries. Otherwise, you’ll have my detailed notes by tomorrow morning.

Thanks for all your hard work on this!

Best,  
Kelsey
