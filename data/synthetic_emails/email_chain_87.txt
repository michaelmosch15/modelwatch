**Subject:** Collaboration on New Optic Lens Project  

Hi Melody,

I hope this email finds you well. I’m reaching out to discuss the new optic lens project we’re spearheading in collaboration with the radiography team. I believe your expertise in therapeutic radiography will be invaluable, especially regarding the impact of our lenses on radiation therapy precision.

We are currently in the preliminary phase of material selection and design optimization. Given your background, it would be great to have your input on how different lens materials might interact with radiation exposure.

Could we schedule a meeting to discuss this in further detail? I’m available for a call or a face-to-face meeting at the South Campus office anytime this week, except Friday as I’ll be on leave for a family commitment.

Looking forward to your thoughts.

Best,

Hi Manuel,

Thank you for reaching out! I’m excited about the potential of the new optic lens project. Integrating therapeutic radiography perspectives early on can indeed enhance the effectiveness of the lenses, especially in oncological applications.

I’d be glad to provide insights on material interactions and how we can mitigate any adverse effects on radiation therapy. Wednesday at 2 PM works for me for a meeting at the South Campus. Let me know if that fits your schedule.

Also, as an FYI, I’ll be attending a radiography conference next month from the 3rd to the 7th, which might provide additional insights from industry leaders that could benefit our project.

Looking forward to our collaboration.

Best regards,
