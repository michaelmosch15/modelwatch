**Subject:** Consultation Request for New Wellness Initiative

Hi Katie,

I hope this email finds you well. I'm reaching out to discuss a new initiative we're planning to launch in the coming quarter that aims to enhance workplace wellness. Given your expertise in educational psychology, your insights would be invaluable.

The project, tentatively named "Wellness First," is designed to support our employees through structured programs that focus on mental health and work-life balance. We have a preliminary framework ready, but I believe a psychological perspective could significantly enhance our approach.

Could we possibly schedule a meeting next week to go over the details? I’m available most mornings before 11 AM. Let me know what works best for you.

Looking forward to your thoughts.

Best,

Hi Sonya,

Thank you for reaching out! The "Wellness First" initiative sounds like a fantastic project, and I'm thrilled at the opportunity to contribute. Integrating educational psychology into the framework can indeed provide a more holistic approach to employee wellness.

I'm available next Tuesday at 10 AM. Does that work for you? We can meet in my office on the 5th floor, room 515. If there are any specific materials or data you’d like me to review beforehand, feel free to send them over.

Also, as a heads-up, I'll be on leave from November 15th to November 22nd, so we might want to finalize the framework before then if possible.

Looking forward to our discussion.

Best regards,
