Hi Jesse,

I hope this message finds you well. I am reaching out to discuss a potential collaboration opportunity that could align with both our roles here at Merck. As you know, Merck has been increasingly committed to community engagement and educational outreach, particularly in areas that intersect with our expertise.

Given your extensive experience as a field seismologist, I believe there is a unique opportunity to develop an educational program that bridges pharmaceutical sciences with geosciences. This could not only enhance public understanding of our work but also inspire future generations to consider careers in STEM fields.

Could we schedule a time to discuss this in more detail? I am available for a meeting next week, preferably on Tuesday or Thursday morning. Let me know what works best for you.

Looking forward to your thoughts.

Best regards,

Hi Doris,

Thank you for reaching out with this exciting proposal. I completely agree that there’s a lot of potential in creating an educational outreach program that intertwines pharmaceutical and geoscience principles. It’s an innovative approach that could really set Merck apart in community engagement.

I’m particularly interested in how we might incorporate real-world applications of our research into the program, maybe even through interactive workshops or virtual field trips. Tuesday morning would work perfectly for me to discuss this further. How about we meet at 10:00 AM at the main conference room on the 3rd floor?

Also, as a heads up, I'll be on leave starting October 20th for a field research project, so I’d love to get the ball rolling on this before then.

Looking forward to our meeting.

Best,
