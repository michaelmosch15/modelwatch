Hi Breanna,

I hope this message finds you well. I’m reaching out to discuss a potential collaboration on a new dental product development initiative that aligns with our ongoing efforts to expand Merck's oral health product line.

As you are aware, our team is currently focused on developing an innovative fluoride-based mouthwash that aims to enhance enamel protection. Given your expertise in chemical formulation, we would greatly benefit from your insights into optimizing the fluoride concentration and ensuring stability over time.

Could we schedule a time to discuss this further? I’m available for a meeting this week on Wednesday or Thursday afternoon. Please let me know your availability.

Looking forward to your valuable input.

Best regards,

Hi Erin,

Thank you for reaching out. I’m excited about the possibility of collaborating on this project. Your focus on the fluoride-based mouthwash sounds promising, and ensuring the right chemical balance will be crucial for its efficacy and safety.

I can definitely provide support with the formulation and stability testing. Wednesday afternoon works for me. How about we meet at 3 PM in your office? This will also give us the opportunity to discuss any preliminary data you might have collected.

Looking forward to working together on this. Please let me know if there are any documents I should review prior to our meeting.

Best,
