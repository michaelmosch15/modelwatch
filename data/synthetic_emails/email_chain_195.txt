Hi Robyn,

I hope this email finds you well. As we gear up for Q1, I wanted to touch base regarding our retail strategy for the over-the-counter (OTC) product line. Given our recent market analysis, it's crucial we streamline our merchandising efforts, particularly in the Northeast region.

Could you share your insights on the current shelf placements and any initial feedback from the field reps? I believe aligning our strategies will be key to maximizing visibility and driving consumer engagement. Also, let's coordinate a time for a virtual meeting next week to discuss this in more detail.

On a side note, I'll be out of the office from October 23-27 for my sister's wedding, but reachable via email if anything urgent comes up.

Looking forward to your thoughts.

Best,

Hi Collin,

Thanks for reaching out. I completely agree that a cohesive approach for our OTC products will be pivotal for Q1. I've been reviewing the data from our last quarter's displays, and there are definitely some opportunities for optimizing our shelf placements, particularly in high-traffic stores.

I'll compile a report with the latest feedback from our field reps and suggest some actionable strategies. Let's schedule our virtual meeting for Tuesday, October 17th, at 2 PM. Does that work for you? I'll send a calendar invite with a Teams link shortly.

Congratulations on your sister's wedding! I'll make sure to keep you in the loop and only reach out if it's absolutely necessary during your time away.

Best regards,
