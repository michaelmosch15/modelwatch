Hi Tanya,

I hope this message finds you well. I wanted to discuss the integration of psychological resilience programs into our broader emergency preparedness strategy at Merck. Given the increasing stress levels observed in our recent employee wellness surveys, it seems prudent to address mental health as a component of our emergency response plans.

I believe a collaborative workshop could be beneficial, where we can engage employees in drills that not only cover standard emergency protocols but also incorporate stress management techniques. This approach might foster a more resilient workforce.

Could we schedule a time this week to brainstorm potential frameworks? I’m available Wednesday and Thursday after 2 PM. Let me know what works for you.

Looking forward to your thoughts.

Best,

Hi Larry,

Thank you for reaching out. I completely agree that integrating mental health support into our emergency preparedness is crucial. The recent incidents have highlighted the need for a comprehensive approach that includes psychological resilience.

A workshop sounds like a fantastic idea. We can align it with the upcoming "Safety First" week in November, ensuring maximum participation. I’m available Thursday at 3 PM for a brainstorming session. We can meet in Conference Room B on the 4th floor if that suits you.

Please let me know if that works, and I’ll arrange for the room and any necessary materials. Looking forward to collaborating on this important initiative.

Best regards,
