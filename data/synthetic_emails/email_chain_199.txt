Hi Zoe,

I hope you're doing well. I'm reaching out regarding the upcoming market analysis presentation scheduled for October 18th. I noticed your insights on the recent market trends for our new oncology line were incorporated in the draft deck. They really sharpened the focus on our key differentiators.

Could you please confirm if you’ll be available to present your section at the meeting? We’re hoping to allocate around 15 minutes for your segment. Also, if you have any additional data or recent findings to include, please send them to me by the end of this week so I can update the slides accordingly.

On a different note, I'll be out of the office next week starting the 16th for a conference in Chicago, but I’ll have limited access to email. Feel free to call my mobile if anything urgent comes up: 555-0199.

Thanks,
Candice

Hi Candice,

Thanks for reaching out. I'm glad to hear the market insights were helpful. I’ll be available to present my section on the 18th. I’ll aim to keep it concise and impactful. I’ll also send you the latest data on competitor launches by Friday, which should reinforce our positioning strategy.

Have a great time at the conference in Chicago! If there is anything you need from me while you're away, just let me know. I’ll make sure to handle any pressing issues during your absence.

Best,  
Zoe
