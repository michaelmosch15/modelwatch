Hi Caleb,

Thanks for the update. I'll coordinate with our technical team to ensure the equipment installation aligns with the structural layout you provided. It's crucial that everything is set up correctly to support our upcoming clinical trials.

I’ll review the blueprint you attached and get back to you by Thursday. Also, could you confirm if the electrical power specifications are finalized? We need to ensure compatibility with our broadcasting systems to avoid any last-minute hitches.

By the way, I’ll be out of the office next week starting October 16, so if we need to discuss this further, it might be best to schedule a quick call before Friday.

Let me know what works for you.

Best,

Hi Priscilla,

I hope this message finds you well. I wanted to touch base regarding the equipment installation at the new research facility in Rahway. I've attached the latest structural plans for your review.

We've accounted for the space in the main control room, but I need your expertise to ensure that the broadcasting equipment fits within the designated areas without any issues. Additionally, we need to confirm that the equipment complies with our building safety codes.

Could you please take a look and let me know if you foresee any challenges? If possible, I'd appreciate your feedback by this Friday, October 13, so we can keep the project on schedule.

Thanks for your help!

Best regards,
