Hi Ashlee,

I hope this email finds you well. I'm writing to inform you about the scheduled maintenance of the HVAC system in the Regulatory Affairs office area. This is part of our quarterly preventive maintenance plan to ensure optimal performance and compliance with our internal climate control standards.

The maintenance is scheduled for Thursday, March 9, between 2:00 PM and 4:00 PM. During this time, there might be brief periods of reduced air circulation, and I wanted to make sure this won't interfere with any critical operations you might have planned.

Please let me know if this timing works for your team or if there are any specific concerns we should be aware of. Feel free to reach out to me directly at (555) 014-6789 if you need to discuss any details.

Thank you for your cooperation.

Best regards,

Dillon Garrett

Hi Dillon,

Thank you for the heads-up about the HVAC maintenance. Thursday's timing should work fine for us. I'll inform the team so they're aware of the potential temperature fluctuations during that period.

We do have a compliance review meeting in the morning, but that should be wrapped up well before your team starts the maintenance. I appreciate the proactive communication—it's always a pleasure to work with you and your team to ensure everything runs smoothly.

If anything changes on our end, I'll let you know as soon as possible. Otherwise, we're all set for Thursday.

Best regards,

Ashlee Boyd
