**Subject:** Collaboration on Upcoming Education Outreach Initiative  

Hi Kimberly,

I hope this email finds you well. I’m reaching out to discuss our upcoming Education Outreach Initiative, which I believe aligns perfectly with the ongoing projects at Merck's Science and Art Convergence program.

Given your expertise in advising higher education paths and careers, particularly within the pharmaceutical industry, it would be invaluable to have your input on how we can effectively engage students and educators through our upcoming exhibition titled "The Art of Science: Pharmaceuticals and Beyond." We're aiming to launch this by March 15, 2024, at our headquarters in Kenilworth.

Could we schedule a meeting to brainstorm ideas on how we can incorporate real-world career insights into our exhibits? I’m available for a call or in-person meeting next week, perhaps on Tuesday or Thursday.

Looking forward to your thoughts.

Best,

Hi Christian,

Thank you for reaching out. The Education Outreach Initiative sounds like a fantastic opportunity to engage with both students and educators about the diverse career paths within the pharmaceutical industry. I’m thrilled to hear about "The Art of Science: Pharmaceuticals and Beyond" exhibition, and I agree that it presents a unique platform for showcasing how art and science intersect.

I would be delighted to collaborate with you on integrating career insights into the exhibits. Tuesday next week works perfectly for me. How does 10:00 AM sound for a meeting at the Kenilworth office? We can also discuss potential partnerships with local universities to further enhance the program.

Please let me know if this time works for you or if there’s another that suits you better.

Best regards,

Hi Kimberly,

Tuesday at 10:00 AM works perfectly. Let’s meet at the main conference room on the 3rd floor. I’ll prepare some initial ideas and gather relevant data on our current outreach engagements to help guide our discussion.

Looking forward to our collaboration and hopefully creating a truly impactful exhibition that inspires the next generation of scientists and artists.

See you next week!
