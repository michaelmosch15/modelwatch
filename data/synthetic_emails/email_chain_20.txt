Hi Gregory,

I hope this email finds you well. I’m reaching out to discuss the upcoming Military Nutritional Optimization Project we’re launching at Merck. Given your expertise in managing operations and supply chains, your insights could be invaluable in coordinating the logistics for distributing our new line of fortified nutrition products to bases.

We’ve scheduled an initial briefing session on October 20th at 10:00 AM in Conference Room B, and I’d love for you to join us. Your experience in managing fast-paced environments could greatly help streamline our distribution process.

Let me know if you can make it. If not, we can set up a separate meeting to catch up. Also, if you have any preliminary thoughts, feel free to share them.

Best regards,

Rhonda Pittman

Hi Rhonda,

Thank you for reaching out regarding the Military Nutritional Optimization Project. I’m thrilled about the opportunity to collaborate and leverage my logistics experience. I agree that my background in managing dynamic environments could be beneficial in ensuring efficient distribution.

I’ll be available for the briefing session on October 20th at 10:00 AM. I’m looking forward to learning more about the project and contributing wherever I can. In the meantime, I’ll review the preliminary materials you sent over.

Also, I’ll be on leave from October 23rd to October 30th, so let’s ensure we have everything aligned before then.
