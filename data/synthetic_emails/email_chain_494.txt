Hi Shelley,

I hope this message finds you well. I'm writing to provide you with an update on the hydrographic survey data that might impact the production design elements for the upcoming pharmaceutical launch event.

As you know, our team has been collecting data from the site in New Jersey where the new production facility is under construction. We've identified some critical information regarding the water flow and potential impact on the surrounding environment, which could influence the setup and design for your upcoming project.

The survey results indicate a need for some design modifications, especially concerning the water management systems that are part of the visual set design. I suggest we schedule a meeting to discuss these findings in detail. I am available this Thursday or Friday afternoon. Please let me know your preferred time.

Looking forward to your feedback.

Best regards,

Hi Colleen,

Thank you for the update and for sharing the survey results. This information is indeed crucial for our production design, especially with the launch event scheduled for next quarter. I appreciate the proactive approach you're taking to ensure everything aligns with the environmental standards and aesthetic goals.

I can meet on Thursday at 3 PM. We can go over the data and discuss any necessary adjustments to the design. I'll arrange to have our environmental consultant join us as well to provide additional insights.

Looking forward to our collaboration to make this launch a success. 

Best,
