Hi Jake,

I hope this message finds you well.

I wanted to reach out regarding our ongoing project on implementing sustainable practices within our research facilities. Given your expertise and leadership in the neuroscience division, your insights would be invaluable as we aim to enhance our environmental impact awareness in the labs.

Specifically, I am looking to gather input on how we can integrate sustainable materials and energy-efficient processes in the equipment and methodologies used in your department. This initiative aligns with Merck's 2025 sustainability goals, and having a detailed perspective from each division will be crucial for our collective success.

Could we schedule a brief meeting to discuss this further? I’m available for a call this Thursday after 3 PM if that works for you, or we can meet in person if you're in the Rahway office this week.

Looking forward to your thoughts.

Best regards,

John Marsh

Hi John,

Thank you for reaching out. This initiative sounds like a fantastic step forward for our team and Merck as a whole. I agree that we need to prioritize sustainability, and I’m eager to explore how we can make meaningful changes in our neuroscience facilities.

I’ll be working from the Rahway office this Thursday and would be available for a meeting at 4 PM. Alternatively, if you prefer a call, just let me know, and I’ll ensure my schedule is free.

Additionally, I’ve recently reviewed a few sustainable lab practices that other pharmaceutical companies have adopted, and I’d be happy to share these insights during our discussion.

Looking forward to collaborating on this project.

Best,

P.S. I'll be on leave starting next Friday for a conference, so let's aim to iron out the details this week if possible.
