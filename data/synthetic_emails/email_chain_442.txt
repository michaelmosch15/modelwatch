Hi Jaclyn,

I hope this message finds you well. I'm reaching out to discuss a potential collaboration between our departments. As you may know, Merck is committed to integrating sustainable practices across all its operations, and we’re looking to develop an educational program for our employees that focuses on sustainable forestry and arboriculture.

Given your expertise in adult education, I believe you could play a pivotal role in structuring the educational sessions to maximize engagement and learning outcomes. We’re considering a series of workshops and interactive sessions that would blend theoretical knowledge with practical applications, tailored to our industry’s context.

Could we schedule a time to discuss this further? I’m available for a call this Thursday or Friday afternoon. Let me know what works for you.

Looking forward to your thoughts.

Best regards,

Angela Hester

Hi Angela,

Thank you for reaching out—I’m really excited about this initiative! Integrating sustainability into our educational programs aligns perfectly with Merck’s strategic goals and values. I agree that enhancing employee awareness and knowledge in this area is crucial.

I’m available for a call on Thursday at 3 PM. Let’s discuss how we can structure the sessions to not only inform but also inspire our colleagues to adopt more sustainable practices in their daily work. We could incorporate case studies and perhaps even virtual field trips to some of our pilot sites.

Also, I’ll be out of the office next week attending an educational conference, so it would be great to outline the key elements before then.

Looking forward to our conversation.

Best,
