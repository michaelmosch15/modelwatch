Hi Julia,

I hope this email finds you well. I am reaching out to discuss the budget allocations for the new advertising campaign slated to launch in Q1 2024 for our upcoming pharmaceutical product, Revitalex.

As the campaign's financial oversight, I need to ensure that all projected expenses align with our quarterly financial plans. Could you provide me with a detailed breakdown of the budgetary requirements for this project? It would be great to have this information by October 20th, as I will be on leave starting the following week and would like to finalize the numbers before then.

Additionally, if there are any changes to the expected media spend or unforeseen expenditures, please let me know as soon as possible. Feel free to reach out at my direct line, (555) 123-4567, if you need to discuss this in further detail.

Looking forward to your prompt response.

Best,  
Maurice

Hi Maurice,

Thanks for reaching out. I'm glad you brought this up, and I completely understand the urgency given your upcoming leave.

I've attached a preliminary budget breakdown for the Revitalex campaign. We plan to allocate the majority of the funds towards digital and television advertising, with a smaller portion set aside for print and event sponsorships. I've also included a contingency fund for any unexpected costs.

Please review the attached document and let me know if there are any areas that need adjustment. I'll be in the office all week, so feel free to drop by if you'd prefer to discuss in person. My office is on the 4th floor, Room 405.

Let's aim to have everything wrapped up by the end of next week so you can enjoy your leave without any pending tasks.

Best regards,  
Julia
