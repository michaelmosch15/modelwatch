Subject: Collaboration on Upcoming Pharma Video Project

---

Hi Kurt,

I hope this message finds you well. I'm reaching out to discuss the upcoming video project we're developing to highlight the launch of our new immunotherapy treatment. As you know, this initiative is critical for our Q1 marketing strategy, and I believe your insights could be invaluable.

We're aiming to create a compelling narrative that not only showcases the scientific innovation but also resonates emotionally with our target audience. Given your expertise in crafting impactful marketing campaigns, I would appreciate your thoughts on the preliminary storyboard. Could we perhaps schedule a meeting next week to discuss this in more detail? I'm available Monday and Wednesday after 2 PM.

Looking forward to your feedback.

Best regards,

Hi Darrell,

Thanks for reaching out! I'm excited to hear about the progress on the video project. It's a fantastic opportunity to highlight the groundbreaking work we're doing in immunotherapy.

I'd be happy to meet and discuss the storyboard. How about we aim for Wednesday at 3 PM? This will give me some time to review the materials you have prepared. We can meet in the main conference room on the 5th floor.

Also, as a heads up, I'll be out of the office from October 20th to 27th for a conference in Frankfurt. If we need to coordinate any follow-up actions, it might be best to finalize them before then.

Looking forward to our collaboration!

Best,
