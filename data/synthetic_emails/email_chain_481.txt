Hi Cristina,

I hope this message finds you well. I'm writing to coordinate the upcoming health and safety inspection for our new laboratory facilities at the Rahway site. As you know, ensuring compliance with industry standards is crucial before we can commence operations.

Could we schedule a walkthrough this Thursday, October 19th? I believe it would be beneficial if we conducted a joint review, given your expertise in identifying potential safety hazards. Please let me know your availability.

Also, I wanted to mention that I will be out of the office next week for personal leave, so I'm aiming to wrap up all pending assessments by Friday. You can reach me at my direct line, (908) 555-0142, should you need to discuss any specifics beforehand.

Looking forward to your confirmation.

Best,

Hi Deanna,

Thanks for reaching out. I'm available this Thursday for a walkthrough of the Rahway labs. Let's aim for 2:00 PM, if that fits your schedule. We can meet at the main entrance, and I'll bring the updated checklist to ensure we cover all the critical areas.

I appreciate the heads-up about your leave. I’ll make sure we wrap everything up before then. If there's anything specific you think we should focus on, feel free to send over the details ahead of time.

Looking forward to working together on this. Ensuring our facilities meet the highest safety standards is always a top priority.

Best regards,
