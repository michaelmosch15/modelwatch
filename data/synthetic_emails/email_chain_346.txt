Hi Jesus,

I hope this email finds you well. I'm reaching out to discuss the current status of Project Helios, particularly regarding the development timeline. As you know, we've been encountering some technical challenges related to the integration of the new API with our existing infrastructure at the West Point site. Our team has been working diligently to address these issues, but it has affected our initial timeline estimates.

Given your strategic oversight, I wanted to update you directly and discuss potential impacts on our launch dates and any strategic adjustments that might be necessary. Could we schedule a brief call this week to align on our next steps? I’m generally available after 1 PM on Wednesday or anytime on Friday. Please let me know what works best for you.

Looking forward to your guidance.

Best regards,

Hi Johnny,

Thank you for the update on Project Helios. I appreciate your proactive approach to informing me about the current challenges. I understand how critical the API integration is for the success of this project, and it's crucial that we address these issues promptly to avoid further delays.

Let's schedule a call for Friday at 10:00 AM. I'll make sure to bring in some insights from the strategic planning team to see how we can best support the technical side and adjust our timelines accordingly. Please confirm if this time works for you.

Thanks for your dedication to this project. I'll also be in the Rahway office next week, so if you need any further discussions in person, we can arrange that too.

Best,
