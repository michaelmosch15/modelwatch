Subject: Collaboration on Employee Wellness Program  

Hi Levi,

I hope this email finds you well. I’m reaching out to discuss a potential collaboration between the fitness center and your acupuncture services for our upcoming Employee Wellness Program. Our goal is to enhance our team’s health and well-being, especially as we prepare for the launch of the new cardiovascular drug in Q1.

I believe that incorporating acupuncture sessions could be a great addition to our wellness offerings, complementing the fitness routines we have. Could we schedule a time to discuss how we might structure this collaboration? I’m aiming to finalize the plan by November 15th for a launch in early December. 

Let me know your availability next week. I’m generally free in the afternoons, and we could meet in the fitness center's conference room, or I can come to your office. 

Best regards,

Tonya Riggs

Hi Tonya,

Thank you for reaching out! The idea of integrating acupuncture into the Employee Wellness Program sounds exciting and beneficial. I’m thrilled to explore how we can support our colleagues together.

I’m available next Wednesday and Thursday afternoon. Let’s meet at the fitness center's conference room—Wednesday at 2 PM works best for me if that fits into your schedule. We can discuss session structures, participant feedback mechanisms, and any logistical aspects we need to consider.

Looking forward to our meeting. Please let me know if you need any documents or data beforehand. 

Best,
