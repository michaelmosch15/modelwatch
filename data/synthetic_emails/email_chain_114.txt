**Subject:** Coordination on Site Surveys for New Development Project

Hi Raymond,

I hope this email finds you well. I am reaching out to discuss the upcoming site surveys for our new development project in Nairobi. As you're aware, the project is pivotal for our expansion into the East African market and aligns with Merck's strategic goals for 2024.

Could we schedule a meeting sometime next week to go over the preliminary logistics and any specific geomatics data requirements you might need from our end? I believe aligning early on the survey parameters will be crucial for a smooth execution.

Additionally, I'll be on leave from November 10th to 15th, so if possible, let’s try to finalize our initial plans before then. Feel free to call me at my direct line, 555-0192-334, if there’s anything urgent.

Looking forward to your insights.

Best,

Hi Alexa,

Thanks for reaching out. I completely agree that sorting out the logistics early on is essential for the project’s success. I have some availability on Tuesday and Thursday next week; let me know if either works for you.

Regarding the site surveys, I'll need detailed topographical maps and any environmental impact assessments you might already have. This will help us tailor our approach and equipment selection effectively. We might also consider incorporating some drone surveys to enhance our data collection.

I'll make sure we finalize our plans before your leave. Looking forward to collaborating on this exciting venture.
