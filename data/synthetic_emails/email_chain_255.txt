Hi Lynn,

I hope this message finds you well. I’m currently working on an article for the upcoming issue of our industry magazine, focusing on recent advancements in oncology treatments here at Merck. I recall you mentioned a while back about the promising results from the latest trials of Pembrolizumab.

Could you help facilitate a brief interview with Dr. Elena Torres from our R&D department? Her insights would be invaluable, particularly on how these developments might influence our future pipeline strategies. Ideally, I would like to schedule this for next week if possible.

Additionally, if you have any recent press releases or internal documents that could be shared, that would be greatly appreciated.

Looking forward to your response.

Best,

Hi Krista,

Thanks for reaching out. I’d be happy to assist with coordinating an interview with Dr. Torres. She’s currently out of the office but is scheduled to return on October 16th. I’ll check her availability for next week and get back to you with some potential times.

In the meantime, I’ll forward you the latest press release on Pembrolizumab and a summary of the recent trial outcomes. You might also find the recent coverage in our internal newsletter useful; I’ll include that as well.

Let me know if there’s anything else you need. Looking forward to seeing your article come together!
