Hi Sue,

I hope this message finds you well. I wanted to reach out with a potential collaboration opportunity that could benefit our employees at Merck.

As you’re aware, we’ve been focusing on enhancing our Employee Wellness Program, and I believe that integrating some early childhood development principles could be beneficial for our staff, especially those with young families. With your expertise in managing the fitness center, I think there’s a unique opportunity for us to develop a series of workshops or classes that combine physical wellness with family-focused activities.

I’d love to discuss this idea further and see how we can align our efforts. Are you available for a quick meeting sometime this week? I’m generally free after 3 PM. Let me know what works for you.

Looking forward to your thoughts!

Best,

Hi Sylvia,

Thanks for reaching out! Your idea sounds fantastic and aligns perfectly with our goals for the next quarter. Integrating family-oriented activities could indeed enhance the overall engagement in our wellness initiatives.

I'm available for a meeting on Thursday at 3:30 PM, if that works for you. We can meet at the fitness center’s conference room—Room 204. It’ll give us a chance to brainstorm and perhaps even tour the facility to identify potential spaces for these activities.

Please confirm if this time suits you, and feel free to bring any materials or ideas you have in mind. Looking forward to collaborating with you on this initiative.

Best regards,
