Hi Vernon,

I hope this message finds you well. I'm reaching out to discuss the upcoming project on the design and development of our new research facility in Rahway, NJ. As you know, the expansion is critical for accommodating our growing research team and enhancing our capabilities in biopharmaceutical innovations.

Given your extensive background in designing spaces that foster creativity and collaboration, I believe your insights will be invaluable as we move forward. We’re aiming to create an environment that not only meets functional requirements but also inspires our teams.

Could we schedule a meeting to discuss potential design elements and your availability for a site visit next month? I’m available on most afternoons next week. Please let me know what works for you.

Looking forward to your thoughts.

Best regards,

Hi Tracey,

Thanks for reaching out. The research facility project sounds like an exciting opportunity to create a truly innovative space. I’m eager to contribute my experience in designing environments that enhance productivity and creativity.

I am available for a meeting next Thursday or Friday afternoon, whichever suits your schedule best. A site visit would also be beneficial to get a better sense of the space and its potential. I can arrange to visit on November 7th if that aligns with your timeline.

Let me know which date works and if there's anything specific you’d like me to prepare for our initial meeting.

Best regards,

P.S. I will be on leave from November 20-24, so if we could finalize some initial plans before then, that would be ideal.
