Hi Sheena,

I hope this message finds you well. I wanted to provide you with a quick update on the Manufacturing Execution System (MES) implementation project we discussed during last month's operations review.

As of today, we've completed the initial integration phase at our Durham facility, and I'm pleased to report that we're on track to meet our Q4 milestone targets. The system has already started to show improvements in production efficiency and data accuracy, aligning well with our strategic goals for automation and digital transformation.

Our team is now focusing on employee training sessions, scheduled to begin on October 23rd. We've ensured that these sessions will cover both the technical and operational aspects to maximize user adoption and minimize disruptions once we go live across all sites.

Please let me know if you'd like a more detailed report or if there's anything specific you would like me to address in the next project status meeting.

Best regards,

Hi Kayla,

Thank you for the update on the MES project. I'm thrilled to hear about the positive strides your team is making at the Durham site. Your commitment to ensuring a smooth transition and minimizing operational disruption is greatly appreciated.

I would love to review the detailed report you mentioned to better understand the measurable impacts of the new system so far. If possible, could you send it over by the end of the week? It would be great to have some data to share at the executive meeting next Monday.

Additionally, please keep me informed about any challenges you anticipate as we approach the full rollout. I'm here to support in any way I can, particularly in facilitating cross-departmental collaboration if needed.

Thanks again for your leadership on this initiative.

Best,
