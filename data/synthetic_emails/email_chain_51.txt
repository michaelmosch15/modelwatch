Hi Darius,

I hope this email finds you well. I wanted to touch base regarding the speech and language therapy journals you requested. I've managed to secure digital access to the latest editions of the *Journal of Speech, Language, and Hearing Research* and *Language, Speech, and Hearing Services in Schools*. These should be beneficial for your current project on advanced therapeutic methods for speech disorders.

I’ve set up access through our internal library portal. You can log in using your Merck credentials. If you encounter any issues or need additional resources, please let me know. I can also help facilitate any inter-library loans if there are other publications you need.

On a related note, if you’re interested, I recently came across a conference on innovative treatments in speech therapy happening in Chicago next month. It could be a great opportunity for networking and learning. Let me know if you’d like more info.

Best,

Hi Andrew,

Thank you for securing access to those journals so promptly. I’ll be diving into them this afternoon to integrate some of the latest research into our new therapeutic protocols. The information should be invaluable for our ongoing project with the clinical team.

Regarding the conference, that sounds like an excellent opportunity. Could you send over the details? I’ll need to check my schedule, but it could be a great way to stay ahead of emerging trends, especially with my planned leave coming up in December.

Appreciate your continued support and assistance.

Best regards,
