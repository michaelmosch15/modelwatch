Hi Kevin,

I hope this message finds you well. I wanted to touch base regarding the new broadcasting equipment installation scheduled for Lab 3. As per the project timeline, the installation is set for November 3rd, and I wanted to ensure that everything is on track from your end.

Please confirm if the equipment has arrived at the warehouse, and if you foresee any potential issues with the setup process. Given the critical nature of this equipment for our upcoming trials, it's crucial that we adhere to the timeline.

Additionally, I'll be on leave from October 20th to 27th. Kindly direct any urgent communications to my colleague, Stacey Perez (staceyperez@merck.com), who will be covering for me during my absence.

Looking forward to your confirmation.

Best regards,

Hi Todd,

Thanks for reaching out. I can confirm that the broadcasting equipment has arrived at the warehouse last week. Our team has already started the preliminary checks to ensure everything is in order for the installation in Lab 3.

I don't anticipate any major issues, but I will keep you updated if anything unexpected comes up. We'll also coordinate closely with the IT team to ensure a seamless installation process.

Thanks for the heads up about your leave. I'll make sure to loop Stacey in on any developments that occur while you're out. Enjoy your time off!

Let me know if there's anything else you need from my side.
