**Subject:** Budget Allocation for New Lab Equipment Design Project

Hi Kaitlyn,

I hope this message finds you well. As you might be aware, we're gearing up for the new lab equipment design project, aimed at innovating the glass components for our pharmaceutical manufacturing processes. With the preliminary design phase completed, we're now at the stage where we need to finalize the budget allocation.

Could you assist in reviewing the financial outline I prepared for the project? I’ve attached the document for your convenience. Your insight would be invaluable, especially in aligning our resource allocation with Merck's broader financial strategies.

Also, I’ll be on leave from October 12th to 20th, so it would be great if we could touch base before that to ensure everything is on track.

Thanks in advance for your help!

Best,

Hi Ross,

Thanks for reaching out and sending over the budget outline. I've had a look through the document, and overall, it seems quite comprehensive. However, I noticed that the cost estimates for raw materials, particularly the specialty glass, might need a bit of adjustment given the recent market fluctuations.

Could we schedule a call tomorrow to discuss this in more detail? A 30-minute slot around 3 PM would work perfectly for me. I'll make sure to bring some recent data on material costs to our discussion.

Appreciate your proactive approach, and let's aim to finalize this before your leave. Looking forward to collaborating on this exciting project.

Best regards,
