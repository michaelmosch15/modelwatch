Hi Tim,

I hope this email finds you well. As the year-end approaches, we are finalizing arrangements for the Merck facility tours and would like to coordinate with your team regarding the upcoming site visits.

Given your role in managing the logistics for external visitors, I wanted to discuss the possibility of scheduling a site visit at our Kenilworth location. We are looking at potential dates in early November, ideally the 6th or 7th, to showcase our latest advancements in sustainable production processes.

Could you please confirm your availability for a quick call this week to discuss the arrangements? Additionally, if there are any specific dietary preferences or restrictions for your team, please let me know so we can ensure the catering aligns.

Looking forward to working with you on this.

Best,

Hi Betty,

Thank you for reaching out. The site visits sound exciting, and I appreciate the invitation to see Merck's innovative processes firsthand.

I am available for a call on October 18th at 3:00 PM. Let me know if this works for you, or if there's another time you'd prefer.

Regarding dietary preferences, a few of our team members follow a vegetarian diet. I'll send you a complete list once we finalize the attendee details.

On a personal note, I'll be on leave from October 23rd to 27th, so I'd like to ensure everything is set before then.

Looking forward to our call.

Best regards,
