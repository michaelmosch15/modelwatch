Hi Kiara,

Thank you for the insightful discussion during yesterday's strategy meeting. I wanted to follow up on a few points regarding the Q4 advertising campaign for our latest oncology product line.

Given the current market dynamics and the competitive landscape, I believe it’s crucial that we align our campaign strategies with our broader investment goals. Could you please provide a more detailed breakdown of the projected ROI from the digital channels you mentioned? This will be instrumental as I prepare the financial forecasts for our stakeholders. If possible, I'd love to have the data by this Friday, October 20th.

Additionally, I noticed the campaign timeline overlaps with my upcoming leave from November 6th to November 10th. I suggest we schedule a touchpoint before then to ensure a smooth handover. Let me know your availability next week.

Feel free to call me at my direct line, (908) 555-0198, if you need any immediate clarifications.

Best,  
Daisy Henderson

Hi Daisy,

Great to hear from you! I'm glad you found the meeting productive. I've already started compiling the data on digital channel performance and projected ROI. I'll aim to have a comprehensive report ready by Thursday afternoon, October 19th, to give you ample time for your financial forecasts.

Regarding the overlap with your leave, I completely agree on scheduling a touchpoint. How does Tuesday, October 24th at 2:00 PM sound? We can meet in Room 402 at the Rahway office to go over everything in detail.

Let me know if this works for you or if there's another time that suits you better. I'll also be sure to have the creative team on standby for any last-minute adjustments based on our discussion.

Looking forward to our continued collaboration.

Best regards,  
Kiara Avila
