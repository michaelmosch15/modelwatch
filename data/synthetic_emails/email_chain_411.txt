**Subject:** Review of Exhibition Contracts  

Hi Phyllis,

I hope this message finds you well. I’m reaching out regarding our upcoming exhibition on the history of pharmaceuticals at the Merck Innovation Center. We’re in the process of finalizing contracts with several external vendors and artists.

Could you please review the attached drafts and ensure they comply with our legal standards? We aim to have these finalized by October 15th to stay on track for the opening on December 5th.

Let me know if you need any additional information or if we should set up a meeting to discuss any specific clauses.

Thanks in advance for your assistance.

Best regards,  
Neil Dougherty

Hi Neil,

Thank you for sending the drafts over. I’ll begin reviewing the contracts today and aim to get back to you with feedback by early next week.

Considering the scale of this exhibition, it’s crucial we ensure all our agreements are airtight, especially regarding intellectual property rights and liability clauses. I’ll flag any potential issues I come across and propose revisions accordingly.

Also, as I’ll be on leave from October 20th to 27th, let’s aim to resolve any major concerns before then to avoid delays.

Feel free to call or drop by my office if you need to discuss anything in detail.

Best,
