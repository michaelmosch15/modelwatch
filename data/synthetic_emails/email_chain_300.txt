Hi Caitlyn,

I hope this message finds you well. As part of our ongoing initiative to expand Merck's partnerships with sustainable agricultural suppliers, I've been reviewing the compliance documents related to our new horticultural alliances. There are a few items that require your expertise, especially regarding the integration of these suppliers into our existing supply chain.

Could you provide an overview of the sustainable practices these new partners are implementing, particularly those aligned with our environmental stewardship goals? It would be helpful if you could prepare a summary by the end of this week, as I need to ensure all legal aspects are thoroughly vetted before we proceed further.

Feel free to reach out if you have any questions or need more information from our end.

Looking forward to your insights.

Best regards,

Hi David,

Thank you for reaching out. I'm glad to hear about the progress with the new partnerships. I've been in touch with the suppliers, and they are indeed implementing some innovative sustainable practices, such as integrated pest management and water-efficient irrigation systems, which align well with our sustainability goals.

I'll compile a detailed summary for you by Friday, October 13, including how these practices can potentially reduce our carbon footprint and enhance our product offerings. Additionally, I'll highlight any potential risks or areas where we might need further due diligence.

Please let me know if there's anything specific you'd like included. I'm in the office all week, but I will be on leave starting next Monday, October 16, so let's ensure everything is wrapped up before then.

Thanks,
