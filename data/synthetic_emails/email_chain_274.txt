Hi Ebony,

Thank you for reaching out. I understand the need to ensure the library’s resources are up-to-date, especially with the recent updates in our oncology segment. I’ll coordinate with the design team to get the latest specifications and material details for the brochures and any other print materials you might need.

Could you please confirm if you need these by the end of the week? I’ll do my best to expedite the process, especially with the quarterly review coming up.

Also, just a quick note – I’ll be on leave starting October 20th for a week, so if there’s anything else you might need, please let me know before then.

Best regards,

Hi Sue,

I hope this message finds you well. I’m in the process of updating the library’s resources for our team, particularly focusing on the latest developments in our oncology research. We have received several requests for printed materials that detail our new drug formulations and clinical trial results.

Could you provide the specifications and any sample materials for the upcoming prints? It would be great if we could have these ready ahead of the upcoming departmental meeting next week.

Please let me know if you need any additional information from my side.

Thank you for your assistance.

Kind regards,
