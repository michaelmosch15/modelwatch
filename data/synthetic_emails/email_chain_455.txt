Hi Bernard,

I hope this message finds you well. I'm reaching out to discuss the upcoming clinical trial scheduled to start in December, focused on our new immunotherapy drug, MK-5890. As you know, the integration of our hospital's resources with Merck's capabilities is crucial for a successful trial.

Could we arrange a meeting next week to go over the logistics of utilizing the theatre for patient consultations and preliminary screenings? It would be beneficial to ensure that all necessary equipment and personnel are aligned before we proceed. I’m available on Tuesday and Thursday afternoons. Please let me know what works best for you.

Looking forward to your response.

Best regards,

Tasha Shea

Hi Tasha,

Thank you for reaching out. I am excited about the upcoming trial and the potential impact of MK-5890 in immunotherapy. Tuesday afternoon works perfectly for me. Let's schedule our meeting for 2 PM in Conference Room B at the hospital.

In preparation, I'll gather the details on our current theatre schedule and any potential conflicts. Additionally, I'll coordinate with our technical team to ensure that all equipment is functioning optimally. Please let me know if there are any specific requirements or topics you would like us to address during our meeting.

Looking forward to our discussion.

Best,
