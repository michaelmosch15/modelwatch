Hi Mitchell,

I hope this email finds you well. I’m reaching out to discuss the upcoming research symposium on October 30th. I understand you’ll be presenting your latest findings on mathematical modeling in drug development, which sounds incredibly exciting!

Given the diverse international audience we expect, I wanted to offer my assistance in refining the language aspect of your presentation. I believe that enhancing the clarity and accessibility of your content can significantly impact how it’s received by non-native English speakers.

Let me know if you’d be interested in a session to go through your slides and talk through your key points. We can meet in my office on the 5th floor or virtually if you prefer. Please feel free to suggest a time that suits your schedule.

Looking forward to hearing from you.

Best regards,

Hi Dakota,

Thank you for reaching out and offering your support. I completely agree that ensuring clarity is crucial, especially given the technical nature of our work and the diversity of our audience.

I would appreciate your assistance in refining my presentation. How about we schedule a session for this Thursday, October 19th, at 2 PM? I can come by your office on the 5th floor. If that time doesn’t work for you, let me know, and we can find an alternative.

Additionally, I should mention that I’ll be on leave from October 23rd to 27th, so I’d like to finalize everything before then if possible.

Thanks again for your help—I look forward to collaborating with you.

Best,
