**Subject:** Budget Allocation for Q1 Media Campaign  

Hi Gabriel,

I hope you're doing well. As we prepare for our Q1 media push for the new migraine treatment, I'm reviewing the preliminary budget allocations. I noticed we have a significant portion dedicated to digital platforms this year, which aligns with our strategy to enhance visibility and engagement. However, I need to ensure that these figures align with the projected ROI expectations.

Could you provide a breakdown of the anticipated spend across the various channels? Specifically, I need clarity on the allocations for social media versus programmatic ads. This will help me finalize the financial projections report due by October 20th.

If possible, let's discuss this in more detail during our meeting on Friday. I'll be in the Princeton office, room 305, from 10 AM. Let me know if this works for you.

Thanks,

Hi Jason,

Thanks for reaching out. I completely agree on the importance of aligning our spend with ROI expectations, especially as we expand our digital presence. I’ve attached a detailed breakdown of our anticipated spend for Q1, with a specific focus on social media versus programmatic ads. We’re prioritizing platforms like LinkedIn and Instagram due to their high engagement rates with healthcare professionals and patient communities.

Friday at 10 AM works perfectly for me. I’ll see you in room 305, and we can go over any questions you have. By the way, I’ll be on leave from October 23rd through November 1st, so if we need to make any adjustments, it would be great to finalize them before then.

Looking forward to our discussion.

Best,
