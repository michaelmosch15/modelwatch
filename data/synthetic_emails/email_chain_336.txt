Subject: Collaboration on Geospatial Analysis for Hazard Assessment

Hi Billy,

I hope this message finds you well. I’m reaching out to discuss a potential collaboration between our teams on a new project. As we expand our distribution network for the upcoming launch of Merck's latest pharmaceutical product, we need to conduct a thorough risk assessment of the regions involved.

Given your expertise as a Chartered Loss Adjuster, you could provide invaluable insights on the potential hazards in our target areas. My team is prepared to support with detailed geospatial analysis to map out these risks effectively.

Could we schedule a time this week to discuss this in more detail? I’m available for a call on Wednesday or Thursday afternoon, and I can coordinate a meeting room at our Rahway office if you prefer an in-person discussion.

Looking forward to your thoughts.

Best regards,

Hi Douglas,

Thanks for reaching out. This sounds like a great opportunity for synergy between our departments. I agree that a comprehensive risk analysis is crucial, especially considering the diverse areas we’re targeting. Utilizing geospatial data to preemptively identify potential risks can significantly mitigate any unforeseen challenges.

I’m available for a call on Thursday afternoon. Let’s aim for 3 PM, if that works for you. Otherwise, I’m happy to meet in person at the Rahway office. Just let me know your preference.

Also, just a heads up, I’ll be out of the office next week for a conference, so it would be great to outline the key points before then.

Looking forward to our discussion.

Best,
