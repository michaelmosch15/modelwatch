**Subject:** Reconciliation of Broadcast Equipment Expenses  

Hi Jeremy,

I hope this email finds you well. As part of our quarterly financial review, I'm currently reconciling the expenses related to our broadcast equipment used during the recent pharmaceutical symposium held last month. 

Could you provide the detailed expense breakdown and any supporting invoices by Friday, October 20th? It’s crucial for our audit trail documentation, given the significant investment in high-definition streaming for our presentations.

Also, if there are upcoming equipment purchases or maintenance contracts that need to be factored into the Q4 budget, please let me know. We want to ensure everything is accounted for before the year-end close.

Feel free to reach me at my direct line if you need to discuss any specifics: (609) 555-0192.

Thanks in advance for your cooperation.

Best regards,

Eduardo Cummings

Hi Eduardo,

Thanks for reaching out. I’ll gather the detailed expenditure reports and send them to you by Thursday, October 19th, to give you ample time for review. I’ll include all invoices and contracts related to the symposium, along with a brief summary of each transaction.

Regarding the upcoming purchases, we’re planning to upgrade some of our streaming servers next quarter. I’ll send you the preliminary quotes and justifications next week, so you can include them in the Q4 budget considerations.

I’ll be out of the office from October 21st to 25th for a conference, but I’ll ensure you have all pertinent details before then. If anything urgent comes up, feel free to call my cell at (609) 555-0234.

Appreciate your proactive approach!

Best,
