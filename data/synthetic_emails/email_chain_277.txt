Hi Katherine,

I hope this email finds you well. I wanted to touch base regarding the ongoing research on the new dental alloy project that we discussed during last month's cross-departmental meeting.

As you know, our team is focusing on developing a more durable and biocompatible alloy for dental implants. Your expertise in metallurgical innovations could be invaluable in identifying potential materials and processes that align with our biocompatibility standards.

Could we schedule a time to meet and discuss this further? I’m available on Thursday and Friday afternoon this week. Please let me know what works best for you. Also, I’d love to hear any preliminary thoughts you might have on this.

Looking forward to your insights.

Best,

Hi Russell,

Thank you for reaching out. I'm excited about the opportunity to collaborate on this project. I agree that integrating our knowledge could lead to significant advancements in the materials we use for dental applications.

This Thursday works perfectly for me. How about we meet at 3:00 PM in the conference room on the 5th floor? I’ll bring along some initial data on the latest alloys we've been testing here in the lab. Also, I recently came across a promising article on titanium zirconium alloys that I think might be worth discussing.

On a side note, I’ll be on leave next week starting from Tuesday, but I’ll make sure that my team is prepared to continue any ongoing work.

Looking forward to our meeting.

Best regards,
