Hi Alyssa,

I hope this message finds you well. I'm reaching out to discuss the upcoming Q4 launch of our new OTC product line. Given the importance of this project, we need to ensure our packaging design aligns seamlessly with Merck's brand guidelines while also standing out on the shelves.

I’ve been working on some textile patterns that could serve as a backdrop for the visual design. Could we set up a time to brainstorm how we can integrate these patterns into the packaging design? Your expertise in graphic design will be invaluable in bringing this concept to life.

How does tomorrow at 2 PM work for you? We can meet in the design studio on the 4th floor. Let me know if that fits your schedule, or feel free to suggest another time.

Looking forward to collaborating with you on this.

Best,

Hi Evan,

Thanks for reaching out. I'm excited about this project and agree that integrating your textile patterns could really enhance our packaging design. Tomorrow at 2 PM works perfectly for me. I'll bring some mockups I've been working on so we can see how your patterns might overlay with the graphics and text elements.

Also, just a heads-up, I'll be out of office next week starting Wednesday for a family commitment. If we can finalize our initial concepts before then, it would be ideal. 

See you in the design studio tomorrow!

Best,
