Hi Jaclyn,

I hope this message finds you well. I wanted to touch base regarding the recent adjustments made on the production line for the ZetaMax project. As part of the routine loss adjustment review, I’ve noticed an uptick in material wastage metrics reported over the last quarter.

Could you provide some insight into the corrective measures currently underway? Additionally, it would be beneficial to discuss any upcoming changes planned to optimize the process further. I'm concerned about the potential financial implications if these trends continue.

Let’s aim to meet this Thursday, October 12th, if your schedule permits. I’ll be in the main conference room on the third floor after 2 PM. Please let me know what time would work best for you.

Looking forward to your insights.

Best regards,

Hi Ann,

Thank you for bringing this to my attention. The recent uptick in wastage metrics you mentioned correlates with the initial rollout of a new automation system. We have identified several bottlenecks and are in the process of recalibrating the equipment to better align with our production goals.

I agree, minimizing waste is crucial, especially with the upcoming fiscal review. We are also planning a training session for the line operators to ensure optimal use of the updated systems—this should help mitigate unnecessary product loss.

Thursday works perfectly for me. Let’s meet at 3 PM in the main conference room. I’ll bring the latest performance reports and our action plan for the next phases of the ZetaMax project.

Thanks again for your diligence in this matter. See you then.

Best,
