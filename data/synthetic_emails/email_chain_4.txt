**Subject:** Health & Safety Review for Project NutriSafe  

Hi Yolanda,

I hope this message finds you well. As part of our ongoing commitment to maintaining the highest standards in our research facilities, I wanted to touch base regarding the upcoming health and safety review for Project NutriSafe. Given the innovative work your team is doing in animal nutrition, it’s essential we ensure that all protocols are up-to-date and compliant with Merck's safety regulations.

Could you please provide me with the latest safety documentation and any recent protocol updates by Thursday, October 19th? This will give me ample time to review them before our scheduled inspection next week. If there are any areas you feel might require additional attention or resources, please do not hesitate to let me know.

Looking forward to collaborating with you on maintaining a safe and compliant environment for your team.

Best regards,

Randy Chan

Hi Randy,

Thanks for reaching out. I appreciate your proactive approach to ensuring our compliance and safety standards. I’ll gather the necessary documents and updates for Project NutriSafe and have them ready by the 19th as requested. I'll also include some notes on the new formulations we’ve been testing, as they might require specific handling procedures.

Additionally, I’m planning to be out of the office from October 23rd to 27th for a conference on animal nutrition trends, so if we need to schedule any follow-ups, it would be great to do so before then.

Let me know if there’s anything specific you’d like me to focus on in the documentation. Thanks again for your support in keeping our workplace safe.

Best,
