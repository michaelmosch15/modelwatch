Hi Mario,

I hope this email finds you well. I am writing to follow up on the clinical trial documentation for the upcoming Phase III study on our new immunotherapy candidate. I've completed the initial drafts of the Investigator's Brochure and the Clinical Study Protocol, and I would appreciate your expertise in reviewing the sections related to histocompatibility and immunogenetics.

Could you please let me know your availability this week to go over these documents? I believe your insights will be invaluable, especially in ensuring we meet all regulatory requirements and scientific rigor.

Additionally, if there are any recent updates or findings from your team that should be incorporated, please share them with me by Friday, October 13th. I'm aiming to finalize everything by the end of next week to ensure we stay on track for our submission deadline.

Thank you in advance for your assistance.

Best regards,

Hi Sheila,

Thank you for reaching out. I’d be happy to review the documentation. I have some time available on Wednesday and Thursday afternoon, so perhaps we could schedule a meeting then. Let me know what works best for you.

Regarding recent findings, we have some preliminary data from the latest trials that might be relevant. I'll make sure to compile these findings and send them your way by Thursday morning. This should give you enough time to integrate them into the documentation before the final review.

On a side note, I’ll be out of the office on Friday for a conference in Boston, but I’ll be reachable via email if something urgent comes up.

Looking forward to working together on this.

Best,
