Hi Lauren,

I hope this message finds you well. I'm reaching out regarding the Mental Health Housing Initiative that we discussed during the last cross-functional meeting. As we move into the next phase, I want to ensure that we are aligned on the housing logistics and support services for our patients.

Could we possibly set up a time to discuss your team's requirements for the upcoming quarter? I believe a comprehensive understanding of your needs will allow us to optimize our facilities for patient support effectively. Please let me know your availability next week.

Additionally, I'll be on leave starting October 23rd and will return on November 1st, so it would be great to finalize our plans before then. If needed, we can loop in my colleague, Mark Jenkins, to ensure continuity.

Looking forward to your thoughts.

Best,

Hi Vickie,

Thanks for reaching out! I’m glad you brought this up, as I've been meaning to touch base on a few key points too. Our team is currently assessing the specific needs for patient accommodations, and we should have preliminary numbers and requirements ready by early next week.

How about a meeting on Wednesday, October 18th, at 10 AM? We can hold it in my office on the 5th floor if that works for you. This will give us enough time to review everything before your leave, and I can also introduce you to Dr. Patel, who has been instrumental in developing our mental health care protocols.

Let me know if this time works for you, or if there's another slot that you prefer.

Looking forward to collaborating on this.

Warm regards,
