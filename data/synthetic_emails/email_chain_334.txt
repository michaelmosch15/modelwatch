Hi Jasmine,

I hope this message finds you well. As we gear up for the launch of our new wellness campaign focusing on mental health awareness, I wanted to discuss how we could visually incorporate some of the psychological insights you've been working on.

I believe adding elements related to stress management and exercise benefits could really enhance our displays and promotional materials. Your expertise in sport and exercise psychology would be invaluable here. Could we set up a meeting next week to brainstorm some ideas? I’m available Tuesday and Thursday afternoon.

Looking forward to hearing your thoughts.

Best,

Hi Tamara,

Thanks for reaching out! I'm excited about the potential of our upcoming wellness campaign and would love to contribute. Integrating the psychological aspects of exercise into our displays sounds like a fantastic idea.

Tuesday afternoon works perfectly for me. How about we meet at 2:00 PM in the conference room on the 5th floor? I’ll bring along some recent data and insights from our latest study on exercise and mental health benefits. 

Also, just a heads up, I’ll be on leave starting October 20th for a week, so let’s aim to finalize our ideas before then.

Looking forward to collaborating!

Best regards,
