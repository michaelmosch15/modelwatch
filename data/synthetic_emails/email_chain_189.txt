Hi Kirk,

I hope this email finds you well. I am reaching out to discuss our upcoming Special Educational Needs (SEN) training initiative that we’re planning to roll out in Q4. We’re aiming to enhance our current training modules to better support our educators in understanding the nuances of pharmaceutical education for students with special needs.

Given your expertise in setting up and managing logistical aspects of our projects, I believe your input would be invaluable, particularly in terms of coordinating the technical equipment and ensuring everything runs smoothly on the day of the training sessions.

Could we schedule a meeting this week to go over the initial planning stages? I’m available on Wednesday and Thursday afternoon. Just let me know what works best for you.

Looking forward to your insights.

Best regards,

Hi Ernest,

Thank you for reaching out. The SEN training initiative sounds like a fantastic project, and I'm more than happy to assist. I completely agree that having a strong logistical framework will be crucial to the success of the training sessions.

I’m available on Wednesday at 3:00 PM for a meeting. We can discuss the necessary equipment, venue setup, and any specific requirements from your end. Let's aim to cover everything from AV needs to on-site support, so we’re fully prepared.

Also, just a heads-up, I’ll be on leave from October 2nd to October 6th, so we should aim to finalize the initial plans before then.

Looking forward to collaborating with you.

Best,
