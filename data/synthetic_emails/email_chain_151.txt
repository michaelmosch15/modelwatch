**Subject:** Collaboration Request for Legal Review on Art Contract  

Hi Phyllis,

I hope this message finds you well. I am reaching out to seek your expertise regarding the new art installations we are planning for the Merck New Jersey headquarters. As you know, these installations are part of our initiative to enhance workplace aesthetics and employee well-being.

We recently received a draft contract from the artist, and I wanted to ensure all legal aspects are thoroughly reviewed before we proceed. Given your experience with contractual law and compliance within the pharmaceutical industry, your input would be invaluable to avoid any potential pitfalls.

Could we schedule a time to discuss this in more detail? I am available this Wednesday at 2 PM or Thursday at 10 AM. Please let me know what works best for you.

Thanks in advance for your assistance.

Best,

Hi Eric,

Thank you for reaching out. The art installations sound like a great initiative to enhance our work environment. I’d be happy to review the contract for you.

I can accommodate a meeting this Thursday at 10 AM. We can go through the key terms and any specific clauses that might need adjustments to align with Merck's compliance standards and legal obligations. If you have the draft contract ready, please forward it to me beforehand so I can review it in detail.

Looking forward to our discussion.

Best regards,
