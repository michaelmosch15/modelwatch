Hi Randy,

I hope this email finds you well. I’m reaching out regarding the upcoming expansion project at the Rahway facility. As you know, the project entails significant upgrades to our production lines, and I need your expertise on finalizing the procurement of specialized equipment.

Could we schedule a time this week to review the contracts for the new bioreactors and associated systems? It’s crucial we align before the end of the month to ensure a smooth procurement process and avoid any delays. I’ve attached the initial drafts for your review.

Additionally, if you have any updates on the supplier evaluations for the stainless steel components, that would be helpful. I remember you mentioning a potential visit to their site last month—any insights from that would be valuable.

My schedule is quite flexible this week, except for Wednesday afternoon due to site inspections. Please let me know your availability.

Looking forward to your thoughts.

Best,

Hi Mia,

Thanks for reaching out. I’ve just gone through the contract drafts you sent over. I agree, it’s crucial to get everything squared away before the month ends. How about we meet on Thursday at 2 PM? I can book the conference room on the third floor, or we could do a virtual call if that’s more convenient for you.

Regarding the supplier evaluations, I did visit their site on September 15th. The capabilities they showcased were impressive, especially their automated welding processes. I’ll compile my notes and include them in our meeting discussion. This should give us a clearer picture of their suitability for the stainless steel components.

Let me know if Thursday works for you or if there's another time that suits better.

Best regards,
