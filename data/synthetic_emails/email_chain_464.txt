Hi Juan,

I hope this message finds you well. I wanted to touch base regarding the logistics for the upcoming symposium on October 18th at our Kenilworth campus. As you know, the event will focus on the latest advancements in oncology research, and your team's presentation is one of the highlights.

To ensure everything runs smoothly, I’d like to discuss any specific requirements your team might have, especially regarding dietary preferences or restrictions for the lunch menu. Additionally, if there are any AV needs for your presentation, please let me know so I can coordinate with our tech support team.

I’ll be on-site starting at 7 AM on the day of the event and can be reached at my direct line: (908) 123-4567. Please feel free to share this number with your team in case any last-minute issues arise.

Looking forward to your input.

Best,  
Tracie Blackburn

Hi Tracie,

Thank you for reaching out and for all your efforts in organizing the symposium. My team is excited to share our findings, and we appreciate your attention to detail.

Regarding dietary needs, a few team members are vegetarian, so having some options available would be great. As for the AV requirements, we’ll need a projector and a couple of microphones for the Q&A session. Could you also confirm if there will be a tech support person available during our presentation?

I’ll make sure to pass along your contact information to the team. Let me know if you need any further details from our end.

Best regards,  
Juan Blackwell

P.S. I’ll be on leave starting October 21st, so feel free to contact me before then for any follow-ups.
