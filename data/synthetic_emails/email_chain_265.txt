**Subject:** Collaboration Opportunity for STEM Outreach Program  

Hi Joanna,

I hope this email finds you well. I'm writing to discuss a potential collaboration opportunity that aligns with our ongoing commitment to promoting STEM education in secondary schools.

As you may know, Merck has been actively involved in initiatives that aim to inspire the next generation of scientists. We are currently developing an Outdoor Science Exploration program tailored for secondary school students. The program seeks to provide hands-on, real-world experience in understanding the pharmaceutical industry's role in science and healthcare.

Given your expertise in secondary education, I believe your insights would be invaluable in shaping the curriculum to ensure it aligns with educational standards while remaining engaging for the students. We are planning a series of workshops and field trips, and I think your input could greatly enhance the educational impact.

Could we schedule a call this week to discuss this further? I'm available on Wednesday and Thursday between 10:00 AM and 2:00 PM. Please let me know your availability.

Looking forward to your thoughts.

Best regards,

Hi Maurice,

Thank you for reaching out with this exciting initiative. I'm thrilled about the opportunity to collaborate with Merck on the Outdoor Science Exploration program. It sounds like a fantastic way to engage students with practical science applications.

I'm particularly interested in how we can incorporate pharmaceutical science topics, such as drug development and bioethics, into the curriculum. These are areas that spark considerable interest among students and can provide them with a broader perspective on science careers.

I’m available for a call this Thursday at 11:00 AM. Let me know if that works for you or if there’s another time that might be better.

Additionally, I will be on leave from October 23 to October 27, so it would be great to get things rolling before then.

Looking forward to our conversation.

Best,
