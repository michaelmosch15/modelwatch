Hi Larry,

I hope this message finds you well. I wanted to touch base regarding the upcoming design phase for the new sterile manufacturing facility that we’re aiming to initiate by Q1 next year. As you know, this project is critical for our expansion plans, particularly for the new line of oncology drugs.

Given your expertise in ceramics and pottery design, I'm particularly interested in your input on the materials we should consider for the sterile surfaces. We need to ensure the materials can withstand frequent sterilization processes without compromising structural integrity. 

Could we schedule a meeting to discuss your preliminary thoughts? I’m available next Tuesday post-lunch if that works for you. We’d also need to loop in the procurement team later on to align on material sourcing.

Looking forward to your insights.

Best,

Hi Tom,

Thanks for reaching out. I’m glad to hear about the progress on the new facility—exciting stuff! For the surfaces, I've been reviewing some advanced ceramic composites that have shown excellent resilience in high-sterilization environments. These might be a good fit for our needs and could potentially reduce long-term maintenance costs.

Tuesday post-lunch works perfectly for me. Let’s meet at your office on the 5th floor, Conference Room B, around 1:30 PM? I’ll bring along some samples and data sheets for us to review.

I’ll also coordinate with the procurement team to gather some preliminary cost estimates we can discuss. Just a heads-up, I’ll be out of the office from October 16th through the 20th, attending a ceramics technology conference in Chicago.

Looking forward to our meeting.

Best regards,
