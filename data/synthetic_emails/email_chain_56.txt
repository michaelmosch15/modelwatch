Subject: Collaboration on Music Therapy Program

Hi Carly,

I hope this email finds you well. I'm reaching out to discuss a potential collaboration on integrating music therapy into our treatment programs for patients with learning disabilities. Given your expertise in music therapy, I believe you would bring invaluable insights to this initiative.

We are exploring ways to incorporate innovative therapeutic techniques that align with Merck's commitment to holistic patient care. Our initial idea is to pilot a program that utilizes music therapy to enhance cognitive and emotional development in children with learning disabilities.

Could we set up a meeting next week to discuss this further? I'm available on Wednesday and Thursday between 10:00 AM and 2:00 PM. Please let me know what works best for you. We can meet in my office on the 5th floor, Room 512.

Looking forward to your thoughts.

Best,

Hi Daniel,

Thank you for reaching out—I'm thrilled at the prospect of collaborating on this project. Integrating music therapy into our programs could indeed have a significant impact on our patients' development, and I'm eager to explore this further.

I'm available for a meeting next Wednesday at 11:00 AM, which should give us ample time to brainstorm and discuss potential frameworks for the pilot program. I’ll bring some case studies and research articles that might be useful for our discussion.

Please let me know if this time works for you. If not, I'm flexible and can adjust accordingly. Looking forward to our collaboration!

Warm regards,
