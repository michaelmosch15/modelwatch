Hi Mary,

I hope this message finds you well. I wanted to touch base regarding the upcoming promotional video set design for our new cardiovascular drug, CardioProva. As you know, we'll be shooting on location at our Rahway campus from November 6-9.

Could you provide an update on the set design concepts? We need to ensure alignment with our brand guidelines and the overall look we want to achieve for the campaign. Also, please let me know if you need any additional resources from the location team to facilitate the setup.

Looking forward to your input.

Best regards,

Hi Audrey,

Thanks for reaching out. I'm excited to get started on the CardioProva project!

The initial set design concepts are almost ready. I've incorporated some innovative elements to reflect the cutting-edge nature of the drug, while ensuring they align with Merck's visual standards. I'll send over the drafts by the end of this week for your review.

Regarding resources, it would be great to have access to the technical specifications of the filming area at the Rahway campus, as well as any existing props that might be reused. If there's anything else you think I should consider, please let me know.

Feel free to call me directly at (212) 555-0143 if there are any immediate concerns.

Best,

P.S. I'll be on leave from October 25-30, but I'll ensure all deliverables are on track before then.
