Hi Kristine,

I hope this email finds you well. I'm reaching out to request your assistance with proofreading a presentation I've prepared for the upcoming Global Market Trends Summit. The presentation focuses on emerging trends in pharmaceutical futures trading, and I believe your keen eye for detail would ensure that it communicates our insights clearly and professionally.

Could you please review the document by this Friday, October 13th? I've attached the draft to this email. If you have any feedback or need clarification on certain points, feel free to reach out. I'm in the office all week except for Thursday afternoon when I have to attend a client meeting downtown.

Thank you in advance for your help!

Best,

Hi Mike,

Thanks for sending the draft over. I'd be happy to proofread the presentation for you. I’ll make sure it’s polished and ready for the summit. I’ll aim to have my feedback sent back to you by Friday morning, so you’ll have time to make any necessary changes before the weekend.

By the way, the topic sounds fascinating—I appreciate the opportunity to get a sneak peek at where the market is headed. If there's anything specific you want me to focus on, just let me know.

Looking forward to working on this!
