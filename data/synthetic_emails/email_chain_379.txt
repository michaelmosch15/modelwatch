Hi Troy,

I hope this message finds you well. As you are aware, we're in the preliminary stages of launching the new audiology research project that aims to enhance our understanding of the ototoxic potential of certain pharmaceuticals. Given the sensitive nature of the data we will be handling, I need to ensure that all involved parties have signed the updated confidentiality agreements.

Could you please confirm if you and your team have received the latest version of the agreement? I sent it out last week, but I want to ensure there are no discrepancies. If you haven’t received it, let me know, and I’ll forward it to you directly.

Additionally, if there are specific concerns or amendments you believe should be addressed concerning the scope of data sharing within your team, please do not hesitate to reach out. I'm happy to discuss any legal implications.

Looking forward to your prompt response.

Best regards,

Hi Tanya,

Thanks for reaching out. I did receive the confidentiality agreement last week; however, a couple of members from my team, specifically Dr. Stevens and Dr. Lee, have expressed some concerns about certain clauses related to data access levels. They are worried about the potential limitations these may impose on our research methodologies.

Could you possibly arrange a meeting to discuss these concerns further? I believe it would be beneficial to address these issues before we proceed with the project. I am available for a call or a meeting this Friday after 2 PM. Alternatively, let me know what time works for you, and I’ll do my best to accommodate.

Also, just a heads-up, I will be on leave the following week from October 16th to 20th. It would be great if we could finalize this before I go.

Looking forward to your reply.

Best,
