Hi Cody,

I hope this message finds you well. As we gear up for the upcoming workshop on November 3rd focusing on speech and language therapy advancements, I wanted to touch base regarding the insurance coverage aspects that we will be discussing.

Given your expertise, I believe your insights on integrating our latest pharmaceutical solutions with therapy protocols could be a significant value-add for our clients. We aim to ensure that our coverage policies are aligned with the therapeutic outcomes you envision. Could we schedule a brief call this Thursday to go over the key points? I’m available between 10 AM and 1 PM EST.

Additionally, if there are any specific case studies or patient feedback that you think should be highlighted, please let me know so we can prepare accordingly.

Looking forward to your thoughts.

Best,

Hi Taylor,

Thank you for reaching out. The workshop on November 3rd is a fantastic opportunity to bridge our pharmaceutical innovations with therapeutic practices, and I’m excited to collaborate on this.

I agree that a call this Thursday would be ideal. Let’s plan for 11:00 AM EST. I’ll ensure I have some preliminary data and patient testimonials ready that could support our discussion. These should help illustrate the practical benefits of integrating our products into speech and language therapy plans.

Also, just a heads-up—I’ll be out of the office starting November 10th for a short leave, so I’ll make sure to wrap up any pending tasks before then.

Looking forward to our call.

Best regards,
