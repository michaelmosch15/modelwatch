Hi Jake,

I hope this message finds you well. I'm reaching out because I've been experiencing some issues accessing the archaeological database that we've been using for our research on historical pharmaceutical practices. It seems that my login credentials are not being recognized, and I keep getting an error message stating "User not found." 

Could you please look into this? I need access to the database by the end of the week to prepare for our upcoming presentation on October 20th. If there's any additional information you need from my end, feel free to contact me directly at 555-0123.

Thanks for your help!

Best,

Hi Michele,

Thanks for reaching out. It sounds like there might be an issue with your user profile in our system. I'll check it out and see if there’s an underlying problem with the database access protocols. In the meantime, could you confirm if there have been any recent changes to your password, or if you've tried accessing the database from a different device?

I’ll do my best to resolve this by the end of the day so you can continue with your preparations for the presentation. Also, just a heads up, I’ll be out of the office next week starting October 16th for a family event, so if there are any follow-up issues, please reach out to my colleague, Sarah Linton, at slinton@example.org.

Looking forward to getting this sorted for you.
