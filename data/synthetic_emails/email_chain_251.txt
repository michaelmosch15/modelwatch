Subject: Coordination for Upcoming Maritime Logistics Conference  

Hi Eduardo,

I hope this message finds you well. As you know, the Maritime Logistics Conference is fast approaching on December 12th, and I wanted to touch base regarding our presentation on optimizing the supply chain for pharmaceuticals.

Given my role in managing the logistics for our shipments, I believe it would be beneficial to highlight some of the innovative strategies we've implemented over the past year to enhance efficiency and safety in our operations. I suggest we also include a segment on the integration of AI technologies in our tracking systems, as this has been a significant advancement for us.

Could you confirm if you have secured the venue at the downtown conference center? Also, let me know if there's a specific format or any other details I should be aware of for our presentation.

Looking forward to collaborating on this. Feel free to reach out if you need to discuss this further. You can call me directly at (555) 123-4567.

Best regards,

Vanessa Weber  
Merchant Navy Officer

Hi Vanessa,

Thank you for reaching out. I'm excited about the upcoming conference and agree that showcasing our supply chain advancements will be a great highlight. The focus on AI integration sounds perfect, and I think it will resonate well with our audience.

I have confirmed the venue at the downtown conference center, and we will be in the main hall, which can accommodate up to 300 attendees. The format will be a 30-minute presentation followed by a 15-minute Q&A session. I will send you the finalized agenda by the end of the week.

If you need any specific AV equipment or have additional requirements, let me know by November 20th so I can make the necessary arrangements. I’ll be out of the office from November 22nd to 24th for the Thanksgiving holiday but will be available via email.

Looking forward to making this a successful event with you.

Best,
