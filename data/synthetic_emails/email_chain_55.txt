Subject: Request for Information on Recent Clinical Trials

Hi Justin,

I hope this email finds you well. I’m reaching out to gather some information regarding Merck’s recent clinical trials, particularly the ones focusing on the new antiviral drug. As you know, there’s significant public interest in these developments, and I’d like to ensure our upcoming article in the health sector of The Daily Chronicle is as informed and accurate as possible.

Could you provide any insights or direct me to someone from your R&D department who might be available for a brief interview? Additionally, if there are any press releases or public statements scheduled, I’d appreciate a heads-up so we can align our timelines.

On a side note, I’ll be on leave starting October 15th, so it would be great to touch base before then.

Thanks for your assistance!

Best regards,

Hi Annette,

Thank you for reaching out. I understand the importance of getting accurate information out there, especially with the public’s growing interest in our antiviral developments. I’ve looped in Dr. Samantha Lee from our R&D department. Dr. Lee has been leading the charge on this project and is well-equipped to provide you with the detailed insights you’re looking for. I’ve asked her to coordinate with you directly for an interview.

As for press releases, we have one tentatively scheduled for October 12th. I’ll make sure you get a copy as soon as it’s finalized so you can integrate any necessary details into your article.

Also, our office is hosting a small event on October 10th to discuss the broader implications of our latest research findings. If you’re available, it might be a great opportunity for you to gather additional perspectives before your leave.

Let me know if there’s anything else you need from my end.

Best,
