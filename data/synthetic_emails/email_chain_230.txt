**Subject:** Collaboration on Patient Support Initiative  

Hi Adam,

I hope this email finds you well. I am reaching out to discuss the upcoming patient support initiative that our department is spearheading in collaboration with the Therapeutic Radiography team. We are focusing on enhancing patient engagement through arts-based therapies, which has shown promising results in improving patient morale and compliance with treatment protocols.

Given your expertise in therapeutic radiography, I would appreciate your insights on how we can integrate these therapies effectively into the existing patient care frameworks. We are particularly interested in how these can complement radiography sessions without disrupting the current workflow.

Could we possibly schedule a meeting next week to brainstorm ideas? I am available on Tuesday and Thursday afternoons, but I am flexible if those times don’t work for you. Also, please feel free to bring along any team members who might be interested in contributing to this initiative.

Looking forward to your thoughts.

Best regards,

Hi Kim,

Thank you for reaching out with this exciting opportunity. I completely agree that integrating arts-based therapies into our treatment plans could significantly benefit patient engagement and recovery. I have seen some preliminary studies indicating improved outcomes when these therapies are implemented in conjunction with traditional treatment methods.

I would be keen to discuss this further and see how we can tailor these therapies to suit our patient demographics. Tuesday afternoon works perfectly for me. How about we meet at 2 PM in Conference Room B on the second floor of Building 5? I will also bring along Sarah from my team, who has a keen interest in multidisciplinary approaches and could provide valuable input.

Looking forward to our meeting and exploring how we can make a positive impact together.

Best,
