Hi Monique,

I hope this message finds you well. I wanted to reach out to discuss the upcoming launch of our new pharmaceutical product, XyloVax. As you are aware, the marketing team is gearing up to create compelling visuals for the campaign, and your expertise in design is crucial to this project.

Given your background in jewelry design, I believe your eye for detail and innovative approach will add significant value to our product's presentation. We are looking to capture the essence of precision and innovation—a theme that resonates well with Merck’s brand values.

Could we set up a time to discuss this in more detail? I’m available for a meeting this Thursday afternoon or anytime Friday. Please let me know what works best for you. Also, if you need any data or insights from our financial projections to assist with your designs, I’d be happy to provide that information.

Looking forward to our collaboration.

Best regards,

Hi Dave,

Thank you for reaching out. I’m thrilled to be part of the XyloVax launch—it's an exciting project! I agree that aligning our visuals with Merck’s brand ethos of precision and innovation is vital.

I’m available this Friday at 2 PM. Would that work for you? We can meet in Conference Room B on the 5th floor. I’ll bring some initial sketches and concepts to the meeting, so we can start aligning on a creative direction. Also, any financial insights you can share would be incredibly helpful to ensure our designs align with the broader strategy.

Looking forward to collaborating with you on this. Let me know if there’s anything specific you’d like me to focus on ahead of our meeting.

Best,
