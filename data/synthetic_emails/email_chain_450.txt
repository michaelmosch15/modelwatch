**Subject:** Collaboration Opportunity on New Office Space Design  

Hi Gavin,

I hope this message finds you well. I wanted to reach out regarding an exciting opportunity to collaborate on the design of our new office space in the Princeton branch. As you know, our team is keen on integrating more innovative and sustainable solutions into our work environment, which aligns perfectly with your expertise in furniture design.

We are looking to create a dynamic and art-inspired workspace that not only promotes creativity but also reflects our commitment to sustainability and wellness in the pharmaceutical industry. Given your experience and the impressive projects you’ve led, I believe your input would be invaluable.

Could we schedule a time to discuss this further? I am flexible this week, except for Wednesday afternoon as I have a quarterly review meeting. Let me know what works for you.

Looking forward to your thoughts.

Best regards,

Hi Vincent,

Thanks for reaching out! I’m thrilled to hear about the plans for the new office space and would love to collaborate on this project. Sustainable design is indeed a passion of mine, and it’s great to see Merck taking steps towards more innovative and eco-friendly workspaces.

How about we meet on Thursday at 11:00 AM? We can meet at the cafeteria in Building 42, as it has a nice informal setting for brainstorming. If this time doesn’t work, please let me know your available slots.

Looking forward to discussing ideas and seeing how we can bring this vision to life.

Best,
