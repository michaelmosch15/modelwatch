**Subject:** Collaboration on Upcoming Safety Report  

Hi Linda,

I hope this message finds you well. I’m reaching out to discuss the upcoming safety report for our new oncology drug, which is scheduled for submission at the end of this quarter. Given your expertise in health physics, your insights would be invaluable in ensuring our findings are both comprehensive and compliant with current safety standards.

Could we schedule a meeting next week to go over the initial draft? I’m available Tuesday and Thursday afternoon if either of those slots work for you. Additionally, if there’s any specific data or recent studies you think should be included, please let me know.

Looking forward to collaborating with you on this.

Best,

Hi Grant,

Thanks for getting in touch. I’d be happy to help with the safety report. Tuesday afternoon works perfectly for me. Let’s say 2 PM in Conference Room B?

I’ll review the latest radiation safety guidelines and relevant studies over the weekend to ensure we incorporate the most recent data. Please send over the draft when you have a moment, and I’ll start looking into any potential areas for enhancement.

By the way, I will be on leave from November 10th to the 15th, so if we can aim to finalize the report before then, it would be ideal.

Looking forward to working together!

Best regards,
