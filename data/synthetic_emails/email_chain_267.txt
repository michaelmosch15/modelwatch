Hi Connie,

I hope this message finds you well. I’m reaching out to discuss a potential collaboration between our departments for the upcoming "Pharmaceutical Innovations and Public Education" initiative that Merck is planning to roll out in Q1 2024.

Given your expertise in operational investments, I believe your insights could be incredibly valuable in shaping the financial strategies we aim to implement for this project. Our goal is to enhance public understanding of our latest pharmaceutical advancements and how they can impact global health.

Would you be available for a brief meeting to explore this further? I’m looking at the week of October 23rd. Please let me know your availability, and we can coordinate a time that works for both of us.

Looking forward to your thoughts.

Best regards,

Hi Tammy,

Thank you for reaching out. The initiative sounds exciting and aligns well with our ongoing strategic focus on educational outreach. I’d be delighted to collaborate and provide any financial insights necessary.

I’m available for a meeting on October 24th or 25th. Let me know if either of these dates works for you, and we can set a time. Also, I’ll be out of the office briefly on October 27th for personal commitments, so I’d like to finalize any initial discussions before then.

Looking forward to contributing to this impactful project.

Best,
