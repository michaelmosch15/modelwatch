Hi Alyssa,

I hope this message finds you well. I wanted to touch base regarding the new employee well-being initiative we’re rolling out at Merck. As the occupational psychologist, I’m keen to ensure that we tailor our programs to support the unique challenges faced at each of our locations.

Given your expertise as the location manager at the Rahway facility, your insights would be invaluable. Could we set up a time next week to discuss how we can integrate psychological safety and resilience-building workshops into your team’s schedule? I believe this could significantly enhance overall productivity and job satisfaction.

Please let me know your availability for a call or a meeting. I’m generally free on Tuesday and Thursday afternoons. Also, if there are any other managers or team leads you think should be involved in this conversation, feel free to loop them in.

Looking forward to your thoughts.

Best regards,

Hi Jeanette,

Thanks for reaching out. The well-being initiative sounds like a fantastic addition to our employee support efforts. I agree that focusing on psychological safety and resilience is crucial, especially in our high-stakes environment.

I’m available for a call on Tuesday at 3 PM. I’ll also invite Sarah Collins, our HR Business Partner, to join us. She has been instrumental in piloting several employee engagement projects and could provide additional insights.

Let’s aim to discuss potential workshop formats, key objectives, and any resources you might need from our end. I’m excited to explore how we can make this initiative a success at the Rahway site.

Looking forward to speaking with you.

Warm regards,
