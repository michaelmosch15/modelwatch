Hi Hunter,

I hope this message finds you well.

I'm reaching out to discuss the upcoming Health & Wellness Expo scheduled for November 15th. As you know, this event is a significant opportunity for us to showcase Merck's commitment to advancing public health through innovative pharmaceutical solutions.

Given your expertise in exhibition design, I believe your input will be invaluable in creating an engaging and informative space for attendees. I’m envisioning an interactive sports health corner where we could potentially integrate some of our latest research findings on joint health and mobility.

Could we set up a time this week to brainstorm some initial ideas? I’m available for a call or meeting on Thursday or Friday afternoon.

Looking forward to your thoughts.

Best,  
Barry Black

Hi Barry,

Thanks for reaching out!

The Health & Wellness Expo is indeed a fantastic platform for us to highlight our innovations and engage with the community. I love the idea of an interactive sports health corner. We can definitely incorporate some dynamic elements to draw in the crowd and provide an immersive learning experience.

I’m available on Thursday at 3 PM for a call or to meet in my office on the 5th floor. Let me know what works best for you.

Also, just a heads up, I’ll be out of the office from October 25th to November 1st, so it would be great if we could finalize the main concept before then.

Looking forward to collaborating.

Best regards,
