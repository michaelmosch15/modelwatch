Hi Wyatt,

I hope this email finds you well. As part of our ongoing efforts to enhance workplace safety and wellness, I wanted to reach out regarding the Employee Wellness Program we discussed at last month's safety committee meeting.

Given your expertise in sport and exercise psychology, your input would be invaluable in developing a comprehensive approach that not only addresses physical safety but also promotes mental well-being across our facilities. I believe there is a great opportunity to integrate psychological resilience training alongside our current safety protocols.

Could we schedule a time to discuss this further? I'd love to align on some actionable strategies before the next quarter. I'm available next week Tuesday and Thursday after 2 PM. Let me know what works for you.

Looking forward to collaborating!

Best,

Hi Denise,

Thanks for reaching out! I completely agree that integrating mental well-being into our safety protocols is crucial. I'm excited about the potential impact this could have on our team members' overall health and productivity.

Tuesday at 3 PM works perfectly for me. We can meet in my office on the 7th floor, Room 702, or if you prefer a virtual meeting, just let me know. I'll prepare some initial thoughts and data on resilience training that I've used successfully in past programs.

Looking forward to our discussion!

Best regards,
