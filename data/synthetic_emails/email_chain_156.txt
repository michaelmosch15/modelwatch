Hi Summer,

I hope this message finds you well. I am reaching out to discuss the upcoming segment we're planning on Merck's Arts and Health Initiative for our internal broadcast. As you know, this initiative has been pivotal in enhancing patient recovery through creative engagement, and we'd like to showcase some of the incredible work your team has been doing.

Could you let me know your availability next week for a brief interview? We’re hoping to air this piece by November 15. It would be great to capture some insights on the collaboration between artists and healthcare professionals, and perhaps share a few success stories.

Please feel free to suggest any particular projects or artists you think should be highlighted. Also, if there are any visuals or materials we should prepare in advance, just let me know.

Looking forward to your thoughts.

Best,

Hi Gloria,

Thanks for reaching out! I’m thrilled to hear that you’re interested in highlighting the Arts and Health Initiative. We’ve seen some truly inspiring transformations, and I’d love to share those stories with you.

I’m available for an interview on Tuesday, November 7, anytime between 10 AM and 2 PM. Let me know what works best for you. I'll make sure to have some compelling case studies ready, including our recent collaboration with the New Jersey Symphony Orchestra, which has been a hit with patients.

I'll also coordinate with the artists involved to gather any visuals or testimonials you might need for the segment. If there’s anything specific you’d like us to focus on, just give me a heads-up.

Looking forward to discussing this further!

Best regards,
