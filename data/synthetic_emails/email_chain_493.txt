Hi Brenda,

I hope this message finds you well. I'm reaching out regarding the upcoming fieldwork scheduled for November 2nd at the Rocky Ridge site. As you know, ensuring the accuracy of our seismic readings is critical for the research project we're supporting with the R&D division, particularly in light of our recent findings on the potential impacts of microseismic events on our new production facilities.

Could you please confirm if the calibration of the vibration sensors and data loggers has been completed? I remember during our last meeting, you mentioned there might be some updates needed due to the software upgrade in August. It's crucial that we have everything in optimal condition before we head out.

Additionally, please let me know if you need any further details from my end or if there's a specific time you prefer for a follow-up call. I'm available most mornings before 11 AM.

Thank you for your assistance.

Best regards,

Hi Jay,

Thank you for the reminder. I know how pivotal the accuracy of those readings is for the success of our project with the R&D team.

I have completed the calibration for most of the equipment, but I'm still waiting on a firmware update for the main data logger, which should arrive by the end of the week. I'm in touch with the supplier to ensure there are no delays. I anticipate everything will be ready well before your fieldwork on November 2nd.

Let’s schedule a quick call to discuss any specific requirements you might have. I’m available tomorrow at 10 AM if that works for you. If not, let me know another time that suits your schedule.

Looking forward to ensuring everything is set for your trip.

Best,
