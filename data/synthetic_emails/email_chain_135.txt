**Subject:** Review of Safety Protocols for Upcoming Facility Audit  

Hi Xavier,

I hope this message finds you well. As you know, we have the upcoming audit of the West Point facility scheduled for November 15th. I wanted to touch base regarding the safety protocols we have in place, particularly those related to radiological safety in our labs.

Given your role in ensuring compliance with trade union regulations and employee safety, I thought it would be beneficial for us to review our current safety measures together. I believe your insights would be invaluable in aligning our protocols with both internal standards and union expectations.

Could we perhaps set up a meeting next week to discuss this in more detail? I'm available on Tuesday and Thursday afternoons. Let me know what works best for you.

Looking forward to your thoughts.

Best regards,

Hi Kaitlin,

Thank you for reaching out. I agree that a review of the radiological safety protocols is crucial, especially with the audit looming. Ensuring compliance not only with our internal guidelines but also with the union's safety standards is a top priority.

Tuesday afternoon works perfectly for me. Let’s aim for 2 PM? We can meet in the conference room on the third floor if that suits you. I’ll bring along some documentation related to our latest union agreements that might offer some perspective on what areas we should focus on.

Looking forward to collaborating on this.

Best,
