Hi Bradley,

I hope this email finds you well. As part of our Q4 employee engagement and wellness initiatives, we're looking to launch a new wellness program aimed at increasing activity levels in the office. I believe your expertise and resources at the fitness center would be invaluable for this project.

Could we schedule a time to discuss potential collaborations and how we might integrate some of the services you manage into this program? I’m thinking about options like yoga sessions, fitness challenges, or even a health fair. I am available this Thursday and Friday after 2 PM. Please let me know what works for you.

Additionally, I'll be taking a week off starting November 1st, so it would be great to make some headway before then.

Looking forward to hearing from you.

Best,

Hi Natasha,

Thanks for reaching out! I'm excited about the prospect of integrating our fitness center resources into the new wellness initiative. I think it’s a fantastic way to boost team morale and promote a healthier lifestyle among our colleagues.

I can certainly slot in a meeting this Thursday at 3 PM. We can sit down in my office at the fitness center to brainstorm some ideas. I’ve been considering suggesting a bi-weekly wellness workshop series that includes nutrition tips and stress management techniques, which might align well with your plans.

Also, I’ll make sure we have a solid plan in place before your leave in November. Looking forward to collaborating on this!

Best regards,
