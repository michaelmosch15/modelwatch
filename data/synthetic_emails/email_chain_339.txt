Hi Vanessa,

Thanks for your prompt response. I understand the challenges you're dealing with on the VITA project, especially with the new alloy formulations. As a follow-up to our previous discussion, I wanted to ensure that we have all necessary documentation in place for the upcoming quarterly tax audits.

Could you provide the updated cost reports for the raw materials used in the project? Specifically, I need detailed breakdowns for the recently acquired nickel and titanium. The auditors will be visiting the Rahway office on November 15th, so having this information by November 10th would be ideal.

Let me know if you need any assistance or if there's someone else on your team I should reach out to.

Thanks again for your collaboration.

Best,

Hi Gene,

Thank you for the reminder. I’m currently finalizing the data with our procurement team, and I should have the detailed breakdowns ready by November 8th. I appreciate the heads-up regarding the auditors' visit to the Rahway office; I'll ensure everything is in order before then.

As for additional contacts, you might want to loop in Emma Li from my team. She's been handling the procurement logistics and can offer insights into any discrepancies you might find.

Please feel free to reach out if there's anything specific you need before I send over the documents.

Looking forward to resolving this promptly.

Best regards,
