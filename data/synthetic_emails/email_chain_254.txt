Hi Cathy,

I hope this message finds you well. I'm reaching out to discuss the upcoming HVAC system optimization scheduled for the trading floor in Building 3.

As you know, maintaining optimal temperature and air quality is crucial, especially in high-activity zones like the trading desks. We’ve noticed some fluctuations in the system's performance, possibly due to the increased occupancy and equipment load. Our team is planning to run a diagnostic check and implement necessary adjustments between October 20-22.

Could you please confirm if these dates work for your team? We aim to minimize any disruption to your operations. If there are specific times that would be less intrusive, please let me know, and we can adjust accordingly.

Thank you for your cooperation.

Best regards,

Hi Marco,

Thanks for the heads-up on the HVAC system work. We definitely appreciate the proactive approach. With the current market volatility, it’s crucial for our trading operations to run smoothly.

The proposed dates work for us, but if possible, could the most intrusive tasks be scheduled before market hours or during lunch breaks? This would help us keep disruptions to a minimum. Our peak hours are generally from 9 AM to 11:30 AM and 1 PM to 4 PM.

Please keep me posted on any updates, and let me know if there's any more information you need from our side.

Thanks again for your coordination.

Best,
