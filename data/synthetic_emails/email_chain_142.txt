Hi Duane,

I hope this message finds you well. I'm reaching out to discuss the budget allocation for our upcoming "Arts in Health" initiative that we are planning to launch in Q1 2024. As you know, this program aims to integrate creative arts into patient care, which aligns with Merck's commitment to holistic health solutions.

We've outlined a preliminary budget that includes costs for artist residencies, workshops, and materials. I have attached the detailed breakdown for your review. Could you please take a look and let me know if there's a convenient time for us to discuss any potential adjustments? I’m aiming to get the final approval by the end of this month to stay on track with our timeline.

Additionally, I’ll be out of the office from October 18-25 for a conference, so if we could resolve this before then, it would be ideal.

Looking forward to your feedback.

Best regards,

Caitlyn Branch

Hi Caitlyn,

Thanks for sending over the budget breakdown. I’ve had a preliminary look, and everything seems in order at first glance. I appreciate the detailed projections—it really helps in aligning with our financial forecasts.

Let's schedule a meeting to go over the figures more thoroughly. How does Friday, October 13, at 3 PM sound? I want to ensure we address any potential contingencies or reallocations that might be necessary before your conference. We can meet in my office on the 8th floor, Room 812.

Please let me know if this time works for you, or feel free to propose another slot.

Looking forward to our discussion.

Best,
