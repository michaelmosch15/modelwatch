Hi Stephanie,

I hope this message finds you well. I wanted to touch base regarding the health literacy initiative we discussed during last month’s wellness seminar. Given the significant role that public libraries play in community education, I think there's a strong opportunity for us to collaborate on a series of workshops focusing on mental health awareness and the benefits of movement therapy.

I'd love to explore how we can combine our resources to reach a broader audience. Perhaps we can develop a program that incorporates interactive sessions at your library branches to demystify psychotherapeutic practices and highlight the importance of mental health in everyday life.

Are you available for a brief meeting next week to brainstorm ideas? I’m generally free on Wednesday and Friday afternoons. Let me know what works best for you.

Looking forward to your thoughts.

Best,

Hi Ebony,

Thank you for reaching out! I completely agree that this is a timely and valuable initiative. The integration of dance movement therapy could indeed provide a unique and engaging approach to mental health literacy.

I’d be thrilled to partner with you on this. Wednesday afternoon works perfectly for me. How about we meet at 2:00 PM at the Westfield branch? We can use the conference room there, and I’ll ensure we have all the necessary multimedia equipment ready for our presentation planning.

Also, just a heads-up, I’ll be out of the office the following week for a short vacation, so it would be great to outline our core objectives before then.

Looking forward to our meeting!

Warm regards,
