Hi Dan,

I hope this message finds you well. As part of our ongoing effort to maintain optimal conditions in the labs and production areas, I wanted to confirm the maintenance schedule for the HVAC systems in Building 5.

Given that your team completed the recent structural survey, can you provide any insights on potential concerns that might affect our maintenance timelines? We’re planning to start the routine checks on October 20th, and it would be great to align our schedules to minimize any disruptions to the operations.

Please let me know when you’re available for a quick call this week to discuss this further. I’m open this Thursday after 3 PM if that works for you.

Best regards,

Hi Shelley,

Thanks for reaching out. We completed the survey last week, and there are a few minor issues in the ductwork that might need your attention, specifically in the northwest section of Building 5. I recommend that we prioritize that area during your upcoming maintenance schedule.

I’m available for a call this Thursday at 3:30 PM, which should give us ample time to go over the details. Let’s aim to ensure minimal impact on the production schedule, especially with the increase in output expected next month.

Looking forward to our discussion.

Best,
