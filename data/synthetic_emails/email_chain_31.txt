Hi Helen,

I hope this email finds you well. As we approach the end of Q4, I wanted to touch base regarding the budget allocations for the next quarter, specifically concerning your upcoming communications project for the new pharmaceutical launch.

Could you provide me with an overview of the expected expenditures? It would be great to have a detailed breakdown by the end of this week. This will help us ensure that everything aligns with our financial planning goals. If you need any assistance or have questions as you prepare this, feel free to reach out.

Additionally, if there are any anticipated challenges or adjustments needed from the financial side, please let me know so we can address them proactively.

Looking forward to your insights.

Best regards,

Hi Dwayne,

Thank you for reaching out. I appreciate the reminder, and I’ll have the detailed expenditure breakdown ready for you by Friday, October 20th. The budget will primarily focus on digital communication tools and outreach initiatives, as well as a few in-person events planned for the first half of next year.

One potential challenge we might face is the rising cost of media placements, given the competitive landscape in the pharma industry. It would be helpful to discuss this further once I have the numbers finalized.

If it's convenient for you, perhaps we can set up a brief meeting early next week to review and discuss any necessary adjustments. Let me know what your schedule looks like.

Thanks again for your support.

Best,

P.S. I’ll be on leave from October 23rd to October 27th, so it would be great to finalize everything before then.
