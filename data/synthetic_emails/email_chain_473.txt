Hi Lisa,

I hope this message finds you well. I'm reaching out to coordinate details for the upcoming Health and Wellness event scheduled for November 15 at our Rahway conference center. As part of our initiative to promote employee well-being, we are excited to feature interactive sessions that encourage physical activity and stress management.

Given your expertise as a Dance Facilitator, we would love for you to lead a session focused on movement for stress relief. Could you confirm your availability for this date? Additionally, please let me know if you require any specific equipment or space setup to facilitate your session effectively.

Feel free to reach out to me directly at (908) 555-0123 if you have any immediate questions or need further details. Looking forward to collaborating on this exciting event!

Best regards,

Natasha Garza

Hi Natasha,

Thank you for reaching out and including me in the Health and Wellness event planning. I'm thrilled to contribute to this initiative and confirm my availability for November 15. I believe a session on "Dance for Stress Relief" will be a fantastic addition to the agenda.

For the session, a spacious room with a sound system would be ideal. If possible, could we arrange for yoga mats to be available for participants? This will enhance the experience and comfort during the session.

I'll draft a session outline and share it with you by the end of this week. Please let me know if there are any specific themes or points you would like me to emphasize, or if there are any logistical details I should be aware of.

Looking forward to making this a successful and enjoyable event for everyone.

Warm regards,

Lisa Small
