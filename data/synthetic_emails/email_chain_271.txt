Hi Jaclyn,

I hope this message finds you well. Following up on our last discussion, I wanted to touch base regarding the regulatory compliance documentation for the new batch of medications set for release in Q1 2024.

We've made significant progress in aligning with the latest trading standards, but I need your insight on a few sections that pertain to political regulations and potential impacts on policy. Given your expertise in liaising with policymakers, your input would be invaluable in ensuring we're fully compliant and anticipating any legislative changes.

Could we schedule a call this week to discuss? I'm available on Wednesday and Thursday after 2 PM. Alternatively, feel free to propose a time that works best for you.

Thank you for your help with this. Looking forward to your response.

Best,

Hi Oscar,

Thank you for reaching out. I'm glad to hear that progress is being made on the compliance front. Considering the recent updates in the legislative landscape, it's crucial we remain proactive.

I'm available this Thursday at 2:30 PM for a call. I'll make sure to review the current documentation beforehand so we can have a productive discussion. Additionally, I'll check in with our government affairs team to see if there are any upcoming changes we should be aware of.

By the way, I'll be out of the office next week attending a conference in D.C., so if we need to follow up, it might be best to do so this week.

Looking forward to our discussion.

Best regards,
