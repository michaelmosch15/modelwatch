**Subject:** Potential Collaboration on New Career Information Initiative

Hi Joel,

I hope this email finds you well. I am reaching out to discuss a potential collaboration on the upcoming Career Information Initiative we are planning to launch in Q1 of 2024. Given your extensive experience in program research, particularly in broadcasting and film, I believe your insights could be invaluable in shaping the multimedia components of our outreach strategy.

Our primary goal is to develop a series of informative videos and webinars that will not only highlight Merck's commitment to innovation but also attract top talent by showcasing our dynamic work environment. Your expertise could greatly enhance the storytelling aspect, making our content more engaging and impactful.

Could we schedule a meeting to brainstorm some initial ideas? I am available this week, except for Wednesday when I have a prior engagement. Please let me know your availability.

Looking forward to your thoughts.

Best,

Hi Benjamin,

Thanks for reaching out. I'm excited about the opportunity to contribute to the Career Information Initiative. I agree that incorporating engaging multimedia content will be crucial in attracting the right candidates to Merck.

I’m available for a meeting this Thursday afternoon or anytime on Friday. Let's aim for a preliminary session where we can map out potential storyboards and discuss the key themes we want to highlight. I have some initial concepts we could explore, particularly focusing on the innovative projects within our pipeline that showcase our cutting-edge research and development.

Also, just a heads-up, I'll be on leave from October 16 to 20, so it would be great to get the ball rolling before then. Please let me know which time works best for you.

Best regards,  
Joel Houston
