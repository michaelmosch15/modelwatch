**Subject:** Inquiry on Dietary Preferences for Upcoming Benefits Seminar

Hi Jeremiah,

I hope this message finds you well. As we prepare for the upcoming Benefits Seminar on November 14th, I wanted to touch base regarding the catering arrangements. Given your expertise as our Pensions Consultant, I understand you'll be presenting a session on optimizing retirement benefits, and I want to ensure we cater to any specific dietary preferences you might have, as well as those of any key clients or stakeholders attending.

I've attached a preliminary menu for your review. Please let me know if there are any adjustments or specific requests, especially considering any dietary restrictions that might be common within your audience. We've had great feedback on our menu from previous events, but I’m here to make any bespoke arrangements necessary to ensure a comfortable and inclusive environment for all attendees.

Feel free to reach out directly at (555) 014-2398 if it’s more convenient to discuss over the phone.

Looking forward to your feedback.

Best regards,

Kathleen Scott

Hi Kathleen,

Thank you for reaching out and for your proactive approach in organizing the event. The menu looks fantastic, but I do have a couple of notes. We have a few attendees who prefer vegan options, and one of our client representatives has a gluten intolerance, so it would be great to see those considerations included.

Your attention to these details is greatly appreciated and really does make a difference. The session on optimizing retirement benefits is crucial this year, given the updates to our corporate pension plan. Ensuring everyone is comfortable will certainly help foster a productive dialogue.

I’ll be out of the office next week for a conference in Chicago, but I’m available via email if anything urgent comes up. Otherwise, we can touch base the following week.

Thank you once again for your diligence.

Best,
