**Subject:** Assistance Required for Site Planning at West Campus

Hi Kristen,

I hope this email finds you well.

I am reaching out to discuss the upcoming expansion project at the West Campus. As you are aware, the project involves setting up a new facility for our R&D department. I understand your team is responsible for the land and geomatics survey for this site.

Given the scale of the project, we need to ensure that the site planning is thorough and aligns with the expected environmental and infrastructural standards. Could you please provide an update on your survey timeline and any preliminary findings that might affect our planning phases?

Additionally, if there are any specific requirements or data you need from my end to facilitate the survey, let me know. I am coordinating with the facilities team and can help streamline any resources you might require.

I would also like to discuss this in more detail. Are you available for a brief meeting this Thursday at 3 PM? Let me know if another time works better for you.

Looking forward to your response.

Best regards,

Hi Carlos,

Thank you for reaching out.

I’m glad you brought this up. We have commenced preliminary surveys, and the initial findings are promising, though there are a few areas that might require additional soil testing due to moisture levels. Our team is working on the detailed geomatics survey, and we expect to have a comprehensive report ready by the end of next week.

Regarding the data we need, having access to the latest architectural blueprints and any recent environmental impact assessments would be beneficial. If you could facilitate access to these documents, it would significantly aid our analysis and expedite the process.

As for the meeting, Thursday at 3 PM works perfectly for me. We can meet in the third-floor conference room at the main office. Please confirm the location or let me know if there's a change.

Looking forward to collaborating effectively on this project.

Best,
