Hi Preston,

I hope this email finds you well. I’m reaching out to discuss the upcoming Community Health Awareness Initiative that we’re organizing at Merck. We're looking to partner with local entities to enhance our outreach and impact, and I believe your team at the tourist information centre could provide valuable insights and support.

Given your expertise in community engagement and your extensive network, I think there’s a great opportunity for us to collaborate. We’re particularly interested in setting up informational booths in strategic locations around town to maximize public engagement. 

Could we schedule a call to discuss this further? I’m available this Thursday after 2 PM. Please let me know if that works for you or propose another time that might be more convenient.

Looking forward to your thoughts.

Best regards,

Hi Jody,

Thanks for reaching out! The Community Health Awareness Initiative sounds like a fantastic project, and I’d be delighted to explore potential collaboration. Our team has been eager to engage in initiatives that promote health and wellness, aligning with Merck’s goals for community development.

I’m available this Thursday at 2:30 PM, so let's plan a call then. I believe our local outreach programs could really complement your efforts. We can also discuss any resources you might need from us, such as logistical support or promotional materials.

Let me know if there’s anything specific you’d like to cover during our conversation. Looking forward to working together to make a positive impact.

Best,
