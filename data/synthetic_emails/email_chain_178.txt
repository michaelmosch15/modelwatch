Hi Bill,

I hope this email finds you well. I wanted to touch base regarding the upcoming therapeutic research project we discussed during last week's cross-departmental meeting. As the project is slated to kick off on November 1, I believe your expertise in animal behavior will be invaluable, particularly in the initial stages of the study.

We're aiming to assess the impact of horticultural therapy on stress reduction in laboratory animals, which aligns with our ongoing effort to enhance animal welfare in research settings. I think your insights could help refine our protocols and ensure we meet compliance standards.

Could we schedule a brief call to discuss how we can integrate our teams effectively? I'm available this Thursday afternoon if that works for you. Also, please let me know if you have any preliminary thoughts or if there's any specific data you might need from our end.

Looking forward to collaborating with you on this exciting project.

Best regards,

Hi Leonard,

Thanks for reaching out. I'm definitely interested in collaborating on this project. The potential benefits of incorporating horticultural therapy into our animal care protocols are fascinating, and it's a great initiative for both our teams.

Thursday afternoon works for me. How about 3 PM? We can use this time to align on objectives and determine the key deliverables for the preliminary phase. I'll prepare some notes on animal stress indicators that might be useful for your therapy applications.

Also, just a heads up—I will be on leave the week of October 30, so if we can get the groundwork laid before then, it would be ideal. We'll make sure the transition is seamless for when I hand over my tasks to my colleague, Sarah.

Looking forward to our conversation.

Best,
