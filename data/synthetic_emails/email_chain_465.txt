Hi Roy,

I hope this message finds you well. I am writing to seek your expertise on the risk management aspects of Project Helix, specifically regarding the new inhaler design we've been developing. Given your experience with loss adjustment, your insights would be invaluable in identifying potential liabilities related to the product's design and usability.

Could you review the attached design specifications and provide feedback by next Tuesday, October 17th? We're aiming to finalize the design by the end of the month, and I want to ensure we've thoroughly assessed any risk factors upfront.

Let me know if you need any further information or if you’d like to discuss this over a call. I’m available for a meeting if that would be more efficient.

Best regards,

Hi Riley,

Thanks for reaching out. I’d be happy to assist with the risk assessment for Project Helix. I’ll review the design specifications and get back to you with my observations by the requested date, October 17th.

In the meantime, if you could provide any preliminary test results or user feedback, that would be helpful for contextual analysis. Also, I'm scheduled to be out of the office on Friday, so if you need to discuss anything further, please feel free to reach out before then.

Looking forward to collaborating on this.

Best,
