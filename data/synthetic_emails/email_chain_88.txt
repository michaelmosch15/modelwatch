Hi Anthony,

I hope this email finds you well. I'm reaching out to discuss the new compliance training video we're developing for the trading standards team. As you're aware, our objective is to enhance understanding of regulatory requirements and ensure all staff are up to speed with the latest industry standards.

Could you provide an update on the progress of the video editing? Specifically, we're looking at incorporating sections on the recent changes in EU pharmaceutical regulations and the implications for our supply chain processes. Additionally, if you could integrate the interview clips with Dr. Jensen from our Regulatory Affairs department, that would be great.

Please let me know if you need any more content or information from our side. I’m aiming to have a preliminary version ready for review by the 20th of October. Feel free to reach out to me directly at (555) 123-4567 if you have any questions.

Thanks for your hard work on this.

Best,  
Herbert Burch

Hi Herbert,

Thanks for reaching out. The video editing is coming along well. I've already started integrating the content regarding the EU pharmaceutical regulations. The interview clips with Dr. Jensen are currently being processed, and I’ll ensure they seamlessly fit into the narrative.

I’m confident we can have a rough cut ready by the 16th of October, giving us enough time for any necessary revisions before the 20th. I'll keep you updated on my progress and will reach out if I need further details or clarification.

Let’s aim to meet on Thursday afternoon to review the initial draft. Would 3 PM work for you? If you have any other video content or specific instructions in the meantime, please send them my way.

Looking forward to finalizing this project. 

Best regards,
