Hi Breanna,

I hope this message finds you well. As we prepare for the upcoming clinical trial on the new oncology compound, I wanted to touch base regarding the logistics for the radiotherapy sessions scheduled for early next month.

Could you please confirm your availability for a meeting later this week to discuss the setup and resource allocation? We need to ensure the equipment and staffing align with the trial protocols and timelines. I suggest Thursday afternoon, if that works for you.

Also, please let me know if there are any specific requirements from the therapeutic radiography team that we should address beforehand. Your insights will be invaluable in ensuring a smooth operation.

Looking forward to your feedback.

Best regards,

Hi Clinton,

Thank you for reaching out. I'm glad to hear things are moving forward with the trial. Thursday afternoon works perfectly for a meeting. How about 3:00 PM? We can meet in Conference Room B at the West Building.

As for the requirements, I'll compile a list of necessary equipment checks and staff training sessions that we need to cover. I also suggest we coordinate with the IT department to ensure the imaging software is up-to-date and compatible with our current systems.

Lastly, please note that I'll be on leave from November 20th to 24th, so it would be ideal to finalize the logistics before then.

Let me know if there's anything specific you need from my end before our meeting.

Best,
