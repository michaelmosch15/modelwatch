**Subject:** Coordination on Upcoming Regulatory Inspection  

Hi Norman,

I hope this message finds you well. I’m reaching out regarding the regulatory inspection scheduled for November 15th at our new Merck facility in Trenton. As you know, ensuring our infrastructure meets all local and federal guidelines is crucial.

Could we schedule a call early next week to go over the checklist and ensure we’re aligned on all necessary documentation? I’d also appreciate your insights on any recent changes in local compliance standards. I’m aiming to finalize our internal review by November 1st, so your input would be invaluable.

Please let me know your availability. You can reach me at my direct line, (555) 783-9021, or suggest a time that works for you.

Looking forward to our collaboration on this.

Best regards,

Lance Alvarado

Hi Lance,

Thanks for reaching out. I’m available for a call on Tuesday at 10:00 AM. Let me know if that works for you. I’ll make sure to have the latest compliance updates at hand for our discussion.

Additionally, I wanted to remind you about the paperwork for the environmental impact assessment. If we could have that ready prior to our call, it would help streamline our review process.

Looking forward to ensuring everything is in top shape for the inspection. Let’s aim for a smooth process to facilitate our ongoing projects.

Best,
