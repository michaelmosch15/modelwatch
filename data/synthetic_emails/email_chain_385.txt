Subject: Inquiry on Nutritional Therapy Insights for Upcoming Article

---

Hi Anne,

I hope this email finds you well. My name is Dawn Rivas, and I'm a journalist working on a feature article for the "Health Innovations" section of our newspaper, focusing on the intersection of nutritional therapy and pharmaceuticals. Given Merck's pioneering work in this area, I believe your insights would be invaluable.

I came across your recent research on the impact of tailored nutritional plans in conjunction with pharmacological treatments, and I'm keen to include expert opinions to provide a well-rounded perspective. Would you be available for a brief interview sometime next week? You can reach me directly at yfranco@example.org or by phone at (555) 012-3456.

Thank you in advance for considering my request. I look forward to the possibility of speaking with you soon.

Best regards,

Dawn Rivas

Hi Dawn,

Thank you for reaching out and for your interest in our work at Merck. I'm glad to hear you’re covering such an important topic and would be more than happy to contribute to your article.

I have some availability next Wednesday and Thursday afternoon. Please let me know if either of those times work for you. If convenient, we could meet at our office in Rahway, NJ, or we can arrange a call if that's easier.

Looking forward to our conversation.

Best,

P.S. I might be out of the office the following week for a conference, so I’d like to finalize everything before then.
