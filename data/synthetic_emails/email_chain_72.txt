Hi Fernando,

I hope this message finds you well. I'm reaching out to explore a potential collaboration for the upcoming Global Wellness Expo scheduled for November 15-17 in Chicago. Given your expertise in retail partnerships and our shared goal of promoting Merck's latest wellness products, I believe this could be a fantastic opportunity for both of our teams.

As you know, the expo is a significant event in our industry, and we have secured a prime spot for our booth. We're planning to showcase our new range of supplements designed for stress management and overall well-being. It would be great to have your input on effective retail strategies to maximize engagement and drive interest during the event.

Could we schedule a time to discuss this further? I'm available for a call this week on Thursday or Friday. Let me know what works best for you. Please feel free to contact me directly at (555) 012-3456.

Looking forward to your thoughts.

Best regards,  
Vernon Swanson

Hi Vernon,

Thank you for reaching out. The Global Wellness Expo indeed sounds like a promising platform for showcasing our new products. I agree that aligning our retail strategy with this event is crucial for maximizing impact.

I'm particularly interested in discussing how we can leverage interactive demos at the booth to enhance customer experience and engagement. Additionally, we should consider post-event retail partnerships that could extend our reach beyond the expo.

I am available for a call on Thursday at 3 PM. Let me know if that works for you, or if there's another time you'd prefer. Also, I will be out of the office next week for a short vacation, so it would be great to finalize our plans before then.

Looking forward to collaborating on this exciting opportunity.

Best,
