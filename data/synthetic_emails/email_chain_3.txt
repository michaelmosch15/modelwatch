Hi Bobby,

I hope this email finds you well. I am reaching out to discuss a potential collaboration that aligns with our ongoing Oral Health Improvement Program and could greatly benefit from your expertise in environmental sustainability.

As you know, Merck has been actively working towards integrating sustainability into all facets of our operations. Given your role as Nature Conservation Officer, I believe your insights would be invaluable in developing eco-friendly dental health solutions. We’re particularly interested in exploring the use of biodegradable materials in dental products and reducing waste in our oral health campaigns.

Could we arrange a meeting to brainstorm ideas? I am available for a call next Tuesday or Thursday after 2 PM. Please let me know what works best for you.

Looking forward to your thoughts.

Best regards,

Charlene Lamb

Hi Charlene,

Thank you for reaching out. I am very excited about the prospect of collaborating on this initiative. Merging oral health advancements with sustainable practices is a fantastic idea and very much in line with our corporate responsibility goals.

I’m available for a call on Tuesday at 3 PM. We can discuss potential biodegradable materials and perhaps even look into renewable energy sources for dental clinics. I’ve been working on a similar project focused on reducing plastic waste in medical supply chains, so I believe we can draw some parallels.

Please confirm if this time works for you. Also, if you have any preliminary materials or ideas, feel free to send them over beforehand.

Best,

P.S. I’ll be on leave from October 20th, so it would be great to get the ball rolling before then.
