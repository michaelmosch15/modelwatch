Subject: Collaboration on Upcoming Ad Campaign for New Product Launch

Hi Jasmin,

I hope this message finds you well. I'm reaching out to discuss an exciting new project we're launching for our upcoming product, [Product Name]. As you know, we're gearing up for the Q1 2024 release, and we're in the initial stages of crafting the advertising materials.

Given your expertise in the technical aspects, particularly your recent work on the [Project X] infrastructure, I'd love your insights on how we can effectively communicate the product's innovative delivery mechanism. We aim to highlight its unique benefits in a way that resonates with both healthcare professionals and potential patients.

Could we schedule a meeting next week to brainstorm? I'm available on Wednesday and Thursday after 2 PM. Let me know what works for you.

Thanks, and looking forward to your input!

Best,

Hi Blake,

Thanks for reaching out! I'm thrilled to hear about the [Product Name] launch and would be happy to contribute my insights, especially since I've been closely involved with the technical setup for the delivery system.

Wednesday afternoon sounds perfect for me. How about we meet at 3 PM in the main conference room on the 8th floor? This will give us enough time to dive deep into the details. I can prepare some preliminary data and visuals from [Project X] that could be useful for the campaign.

Additionally, if there's anything specific you'd like me to bring or prepare, just let me know.

Looking forward to our collaboration!

Best regards,
