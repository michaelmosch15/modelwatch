**Subject:** Collaboration on Inhalation Device Design

Hi Audrey,

I hope this email finds you well. I'm reaching out to discuss the ongoing project related to our new inhalation device. As you know, the design phase is crucial, and your input on the physiological impacts is invaluable.

Currently, we're at a stage where we need to ensure the ergonomic design complements the physiological requirements perfectly. I've attached the latest sketches and design specifications for your review. Could you take a look and let me know if there are any adjustments needed from a physiological perspective?

Let's aim for a brief meeting later this week to go over any potential changes. Are you available Thursday afternoon? I’m flexible with timing, but preferably before 3 PM.

Looking forward to your insights.

Best regards,

Hi Jimmy,

Thanks for sending over the design specifications. I've had a preliminary look, and they seem promising. I do have a few suggestions regarding the airflow dynamics and how they might affect user efficiency, especially for patients with compromised lung function.

Thursday afternoon works perfectly for me. How about 2 PM at the Innovation Lab on the 3rd floor? This will give us a chance to review the 3D models as well. Also, please note that I’ll be on leave starting next Monday for a week, so it would be great if we could finalize any major changes before then.

Looking forward to our collaboration.

Best,
