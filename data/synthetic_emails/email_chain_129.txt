Hi Jillian,

I hope this message finds you well. I'm reaching out regarding the "Green Spaces" initiative we've been planning to enhance our campus environment at Merck. As we aim to improve both sustainability and employee well-being, your expertise in communications and media can be invaluable in promoting our efforts.

Specifically, I would love your input on how we can best document and share our progress through internal channels. We’re considering a series of short video segments to highlight the transformation and its impact on employee morale. Given your experience with radio production, your insight on scripting and presentation would be greatly appreciated.

Could we schedule a meeting to discuss this further? I’m generally available this week, except Friday afternoon due to a horticulture symposium. Let me know what works for you.

Looking forward to collaborating!

Best regards,

Hi Jacqueline,

Thanks for reaching out! I’m really excited about the "Green Spaces" initiative and the positive impact it’s poised to have. Documenting this through a series of engaging videos sounds like a fantastic way to keep everyone informed and involved. I can definitely help with scripting and ensuring the segments are engaging and informative.

I’m available for a meeting tomorrow afternoon or Thursday morning. Let me know if either of those times works for you. We can discuss potential storylines and the best platforms for sharing the content with our teams.

Also, if you have any preliminary ideas or specific themes you’d like to focus on, feel free to send them my way ahead of our meeting. This will help streamline our discussion.

Looking forward to working together on this!

Best,
