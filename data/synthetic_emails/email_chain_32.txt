Hi Jennifer,

I hope this message finds you well. I'm reaching out regarding our upcoming expansion project at the Rahway site. As you know, there is an area within the proposed development zone that has potential historical significance. Your expertise as an archaeologist will be invaluable in ensuring we respect and preserve any findings.

Could we schedule a time to discuss this further? I am particularly interested in understanding any initial assessments you might have and how this might impact our timelines. We aim to align our construction plans while maintaining compliance with both environmental and historical preservation standards.

I am available this Thursday or Friday after 2 PM. Please let me know what works best for you. Looking forward to your insights!

Best regards,

Hi Susan,

Thanks for reaching out. The Rahway site certainly presents an interesting challenge, given the area's rich history. I have conducted a preliminary review of the site and identified a couple of zones that might require a closer look.

Thursday at 3 PM works perfectly for me. We can meet in conference room B-12 at the Rahway facility. I'll bring the initial reports and some recommendations on how we might proceed without delaying the project timeline. 

Additionally, I wanted to mention that I'll be on leave from November 1st to 10th, so we should aim to finalize our initial assessments before then if possible.

Looking forward to our meeting.

Best,
