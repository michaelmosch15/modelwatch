Hi Kendra,

I hope this message finds you well. As we prepare for the upcoming safety audit scheduled for October 25th, I wanted to reach out to discuss the emergency protocols for the analytical labs in Building 3. Given your expertise and current projects, your input would be invaluable to ensure that our safety measures align with the latest operational requirements.

Could we schedule a brief call this week to go over the current protocols and identify any areas that might need adjustment? I’m available on Thursday afternoon or Friday morning. Let me know what works for you.

Also, please keep in mind that I’ll be out of the office next week for the annual emergency management conference in Chicago, so if there are any urgent concerns, it would be best to address them before I leave.

Looking forward to your feedback.

Best regards,

Patrick Hansen

Hi Patrick,

Thanks for reaching out. I completely agree that it's crucial to ensure our safety protocols are up-to-date, especially with the audit around the corner. Thursday afternoon works perfectly for a call; let’s say at 3 PM?

I’ll make sure to gather some preliminary data from our recent analytical methods validation. Having those insights might help us pinpoint any potential risks we need to address.

Enjoy your time at the conference next week! Let’s aim to have everything squared away before you head to Chicago, so you can focus on the sessions there without any lingering concerns.

Talk soon,
