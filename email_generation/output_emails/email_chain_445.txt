Hi Frances,

I hope this email finds you well.

As we approach the final quarter, I've been reviewing the budget allocations for our ongoing and upcoming projects. I noticed the proposal for the New Green Spaces initiative, which aims to enhance the amenity features around our Rahway campus. Given the strategic importance of this project in improving our work environment and supporting sustainability goals, I wanted to ensure we have the requisite financial resources aligned.

Could you provide a detailed forecast of the projected costs for the initial phase? Specifically, I’d like to understand any anticipated expenses related to landscape design and plant sourcing. This will help us in finalizing the budget for Q1 next year.

Please get back to me by the end of the week if possible. If you have any preliminary figures, feel free to send them over, or we can discuss this further over a call. Let me know what works best for you.

Thanks, Frances. Looking forward to collaborating on this.

Best,

Hi Bryan,

Thanks for reaching out.

I’m thrilled to hear that the New Green Spaces project is gaining traction. I agree that enhancing our campus infrastructure aligns perfectly with our sustainability and employee wellness objectives.

I've attached a preliminary cost breakdown for the initial phase of the project. This includes estimates for landscape architecture, native plant selections, and necessary irrigation systems. The total projected cost for this phase is approximately $150,000. These figures are based on current vendor quotes and market trends.

Let's schedule a call to review the details. I’m available this Thursday afternoon or Friday morning. Please let me know what suits your schedule. Additionally, I'll be on leave from October 20-27, so I’d like to wrap up our discussions before then if possible.

Looking forward to your thoughts.

Best regards,
