Hi Jorge,

I hope this message finds you well. As part of our ongoing wellness initiative here at Merck HQ, we've been tasked with creating a more inviting and inspiring physical environment for our employees. Given your expertise in music and its impact on workplace wellness, I thought it would be great if we could collaborate.

I’m currently working on restoring some of the furniture pieces in the common areas, aiming to create spaces that are both functional and aesthetically pleasing. I believe integrating a music component could significantly enhance the atmosphere. Perhaps we could organize a session where employees can experience live music while enjoying the newly revamped spaces?

Please let me know your thoughts on this and if you’re available for a brief meeting next Tuesday, October 17th, at 2 PM to discuss this further. I’m really excited about the potential synergy between our work!

Looking forward to your response.

Best,

Hi Angelica,

Thank you for reaching out with this exciting opportunity! I completely agree that incorporating music into the workplace environment can have a profound impact on employee well-being.

I would love to collaborate on this project. Live music sessions sound like a fantastic idea, and I can also put together a playlist that complements the ambiance of your restored spaces. I’m available next Tuesday at 2 PM for a meeting. Could we meet at the Innovation Lounge on the 5th Floor? It would be the perfect spot for brainstorming.

Looking forward to collaborating and bringing some harmony into our workspaces.

Best regards,
