Hi Cindy,

I hope this message finds you well. I’m reaching out regarding the new laboratory setup at our Rahway site. As you know, we're in the initial stages of designing the control and instrumentation layout for the facility. It’s crucial that we synchronize our efforts to ensure the space is optimally designed for both functionality and safety.

Could we schedule a meeting next week to discuss the integration of the control systems with your interior design plans? I believe aligning on this early will help us avoid any last-minute adjustments that could delay the project timeline. I'm available most of next week except for Thursday morning when I have a prior engagement. Please let me know your available times.

Looking forward to your insights on creating a collaborative and efficient design.

Best regards,

Hi Candice,

Thanks for reaching out. I'm glad you brought this up, as I was about to contact you regarding the same. Ensuring seamless integration between our systems is critical, especially when considering the lab's specific spatial constraints and safety requirements.

I can meet next Tuesday or Wednesday afternoon. Let me know if either of these times work for you. We can use the meeting room on the third floor of our Rahway office if that's convenient.

Also, just a heads-up, I'll be on leave starting October 23rd for a week, so it would be great to finalize any outstanding details before then.

Looking forward to our collaboration on this exciting project!

Best,
