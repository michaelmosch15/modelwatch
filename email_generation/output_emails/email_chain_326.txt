Hi Micheal,

I hope this message finds you well. I’m reaching out to discuss the upcoming investor presentation scheduled for November 8th at our Kenilworth office. Our team is in the midst of finalizing the multimedia components, and I wanted to ensure that everything aligns with your expectations and the overall objectives for this event.

Could you provide any specific details or preferences you have for the presentation? We're particularly focusing on the new animation sequences for the pipeline overview and the interactive elements for the financial highlights. Your input would be invaluable to make sure that we are accurately conveying the data in a compelling and engaging manner.

Additionally, if there are any last-minute changes or updates to the presentation content, please let me know by October 25th. This will give us sufficient time to implement any alterations.

Looking forward to your feedback.

Best regards,

Rachael Graham

Hi Rachael,

Thanks for reaching out and for your proactive approach. The presentation is indeed a critical piece for our upcoming investor meetings, and I appreciate your team's efforts in enhancing its multimedia aspects.

Regarding the details, I would like to emphasize the importance of clarity in the financial data animations. It’s crucial that the transitions are smooth and the figures are easy to follow. Can we also incorporate some dynamic graphs to highlight our year-over-year growth more effectively?

I’ll be out of the office from October 18th to 20th for a conference, but I’ll be available via email if any urgent issues arise. Otherwise, we can schedule a quick call early next week to go over any additional tweaks.

Thank you for your hard work on this. Let’s aim to make this presentation as impactful as possible.

Best,
