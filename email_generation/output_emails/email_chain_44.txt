Hi Bernard,

I hope this message finds you well. I am reaching out to discuss the creation of the animation segments for the new training module focused on the latest advancements in immunotherapy treatments.

As you know, the aim is to make the content as engaging and informative as possible for the learners. I've drafted a few initial concept designs and storyboards that align with the module's objectives. I would love to get your feedback on these before I proceed further.

Could we schedule a meeting sometime this week to go over these concepts? I think a quick 30-minute session should suffice. I'll be out of the office next week attending the Animator's Conference in San Diego, so it would be great to finalize the direction before then.

Let me know your availability. Looking forward to your insights.

Best,

Hi Maxwell,

Thanks for reaching out. I’m excited to hear about your progress on the animation segments. Given the complexity of the latest immunotherapy advancements, having a clear and engaging visual representation will be invaluable for our learners.

I have some availability this Thursday afternoon. Would 2:00 PM work for you? If we could use the conference room on the 5th floor, that would be ideal—plenty of space to spread out the storyboards and brainstorm.

Enjoy the Animator's Conference next week; it sounds like a fantastic opportunity for new inspirations! Let me know if you need anything else from my end.
