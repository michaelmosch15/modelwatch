Hi Martin,

Thanks for getting back to me so quickly. I completely understand the constraints you mentioned. Let's aim to finalize the fabric selection by the end of next week, say October 20th? This timeline will ensure we have ample time for any adjustments before the launch of our new product line in November.

I would appreciate it if you could prioritize the samples for the eco-friendly materials we discussed. Not only will this align with Merck's sustainability initiatives, but it's also a strong selling point in our market campaigns.

Let me know if you need any additional details from my end. Also, just a heads-up, I'll be out of the office from October 23-27 for a design workshop, but I'll be reachable via email.

Best,

Hi Darren,

I’ve reviewed the list of fabric suppliers you sent over. While I see the potential in a few of them, I need to check with our procurement team about the current budget allocations. Some of the materials you’re interested in are a bit pricier than our usual range.

Could you provide me with a prioritized list of fabrics? This way, I can focus on negotiating the best possible terms for the most critical items. Additionally, I'll coordinate a meeting with our sustainability officer to ensure our choices align with the latest ESG guidelines.

Let’s aim to touch base by mid-next week to see where we stand. I’ll also loop you in with logistics, as lead times might be tighter than usual with the year-end approaching.

Thanks,
