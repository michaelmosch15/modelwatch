**Subject:** Collaboration on Ergonomic Assessment for Upcoming Wellness Initiative

Hi Tracy,

I hope this message finds you well. I’m reaching out to discuss the upcoming wellness initiative that our Health & Wellness Team is spearheading next quarter. As you know, our primary goal is to enhance workplace ergonomics to minimize the risk of musculoskeletal disorders among our employees, particularly in high-intensity roles.

Given your expertise as an ergonomist, I believe your insights will be invaluable in developing an effective assessment strategy. We’re keen to incorporate evidence-based practices and cutting-edge ergonomic solutions tailored to our workforce’s needs. I’m particularly interested in any recent data or case studies you might have come across that could inform our approach.

Could we schedule a time to meet and brainstorm some initial ideas? I’m available this Thursday and Friday between 2-4 PM. Let me know what works best for you, or feel free to suggest another time.

Looking forward to collaborating with you on this!

Best,

Hi Eugene,

Thanks for reaching out—I’m excited to dive into this project with you. Improving workplace ergonomics is a passion of mine, and I believe our collaboration can truly make a difference for our colleagues at Merck.

I have a couple of recent studies and ergonomic assessment tools that we can review together. They focus on innovative approaches in reducing strain and enhancing comfort in dynamic work environments, which I think will align well with our objectives.

Thursday at 2 PM works perfectly for me. Let’s meet in Conference Room B on the 3rd floor; it’s quieter, and we’ll have plenty of space to go over materials. Also, I’ll be out of the office next week for a family commitment, so this timeline works well for us to get the ball rolling before my leave.

Looking forward to our discussion!

Best regards,
