**Subject:** Collaboration on Upcoming Patient Care Workshop  

Hi Jake,

I hope this message finds you well. I’m reaching out to discuss the upcoming Patient Care Workshop scheduled for November 15th at our Rahway office. As you know, this workshop is part of our ongoing initiative to enhance patient care strategies for individuals with learning disabilities.

Given your expertise in occupational psychology, I believe your insights could greatly benefit our session, particularly in developing strategies that address the psychological aspects of caregiving. We’re aiming to create a comprehensive, multidisciplinary approach, and your contribution would be invaluable.

Could you let me know your availability for a brief meeting next week? I’m available on Tuesday and Thursday afternoons. We can discuss how best to integrate your perspective into the workshop agenda.

Looking forward to your thoughts.

Best regards,

Hi Daniel,

Thanks for reaching out. The Patient Care Workshop sounds like a fantastic opportunity to enhance our multidisciplinary approach, and I’d be delighted to contribute. I agree that addressing the psychological components is crucial, especially to support effective caregiving practices for our patients.

I’m available on Thursday afternoon for a meeting. Let’s aim for 2 PM, if that works for you. We can meet in my office (Room 402, Rahway HQ) or, if you prefer, connect via Teams.

Additionally, I’d like to review any existing materials you have for the workshop to prepare adequately. Could you send them over at your earliest convenience?

Looking forward to collaborating with you on this.

Best,
