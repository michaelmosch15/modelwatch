**Subject:** Collaboration on Sustainable Landscape Design for R&D Facility

Hi Julian,

I hope this message finds you well. I wanted to reach out regarding the sustainable landscape design initiative for our new R&D facility in Durham. Given Merck's commitment to environmental stewardship, I'm keen on integrating native plant species that could potentially complement our agricultural biotechnology projects.

Your expertise in food technology could provide invaluable insights, particularly in identifying any cross-functional opportunities between our landscape architecture and the plant-based components of your current projects. For instance, are there any plant species you’re working with that could serve dual purposes, such as improving soil health or providing natural pest resistance?

Let’s aim to discuss this further. Are you available for a brief call on Friday, October 13th? I’m generally free after 2 PM. Please let me know a time that works for you.

Looking forward to your thoughts.

Best,

Hi Raven,

Thanks for reaching out. This sounds like a fantastic opportunity to blend our expertise for the Durham site. I’ve been exploring several native legumes that not only enrich soil nitrogen but also have potential applications in our plant-based protein research. Let’s definitely discuss how these could fit into your landscape designs.

Friday after 2 PM works perfectly for me. How about we plan for a call at 3 PM? I’ll be in the office, so I’ll have access to all the necessary data and resources.

Also, a heads-up: I’ll be out of office for a couple of days next week attending the Food Innovation Conference in Chicago, so if we need to follow up, it might be best to schedule something for the week after.

Looking forward to our discussion.

Best regards,
