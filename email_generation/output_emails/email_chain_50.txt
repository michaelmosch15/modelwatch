Hi Chris,

I hope this message finds you well. I wanted to touch base regarding the ongoing discussions about integrating art into our osteopathic therapy suites. Your expertise as a fine artist could provide a unique perspective on enhancing patient experience through visual elements.

As we prepare for the upcoming launch of our new line of therapeutic spaces—project name "Healing Horizons"—I believe your input could be invaluable. We are aiming for a calming environment that supports the healing process, and your creative insights could help us achieve that.

Could we schedule a meeting next week to go over some preliminary ideas? I'm free on Tuesday or Thursday afternoon. Let me know what works best for you.

Looking forward to your thoughts.

Best,

Hi Maureen,

Thanks for reaching out! The "Healing Horizons" project sounds like an exciting opportunity to merge therapeutic care with artistic expression. I am thrilled to potentially contribute to such a transformative initiative.

I can definitely see how incorporating soothing artistic elements could enhance the overall patient experience and align with Merck’s mission of promoting holistic well-being. Tuesday afternoon works well for me; how about 2:00 PM in the main conference room at the West Campus?

Additionally, I’ll be out of the office from October 23rd to October 30th for a previously scheduled engagement, so it would be great to finalize some concepts before then.

Looking forward to our collaboration.

Best regards,
