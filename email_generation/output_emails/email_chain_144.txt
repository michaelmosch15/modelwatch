Hi Gregg,

I hope this message finds you well. I wanted to touch base regarding the upcoming site visit for the new production facility we're planning to feature in the next internal broadcast. As you know, ensuring the site meets all regulatory standards before we showcase it is critical.

Could we set a time for you to visit the facility next week? I suggest either Tuesday or Thursday, as the project team will be on-site to provide any necessary insights. Let me know what works for you, and I can coordinate with security to ensure you have access.

Additionally, I've attached the preliminary site survey report for your review. Please let me know if you need further details or have specific angles you’d like us to focus on during the shoot.

Looking forward to your thoughts.

Best,

Hi Stefanie,

Thanks for reaching out. I took a quick glance at the survey report, and it seems quite comprehensive. Great work on that! Tuesday works perfectly for me to visit the site. Could we aim for 10 AM? This way, we can have ample daylight for any test footage and still have time to discuss any additional shots needed.

I'll bring along our lead videographer, who has a great eye for highlighting the intricate details that make our facilities stand out. If there are any particular areas of the site that we should prioritize or avoid due to ongoing work, please let me know.

Looking forward to seeing you on Tuesday. Please confirm if this time works and if there are any specific protocols we should follow upon arrival.

Best regards,
