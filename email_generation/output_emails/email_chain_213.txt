Hi Lynn,

I hope this message finds you well. I am reaching out to request access to the latest employee turnover data from the HR database. As part of our ongoing project to assess internal workforce stability, this data will be instrumental in our analysis of potential impacts on the R&D department's productivity metrics.

Could you please grant access or direct me to the appropriate contact who can facilitate this? It would be great if we could have this by the end of the week.

On a related note, I wanted to give you a heads-up that I will be out of the office from October 16th to 20th for a family commitment. I’ve ensured that all my responsibilities will be covered in my absence.

Thank you for your assistance.

Best regards,

Cindy Cortez
