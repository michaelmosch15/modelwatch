Hi Brendan,

I hope this message finds you well. I’m reaching out regarding an insurance query related to our ongoing Project Synergy. We’ve encountered a few patients whose coverage details for occupational therapy services seem ambiguous, particularly those enrolled with Blueline Health.

Could you provide some clarity on the coverage specifics? It’s crucial we align our therapy plans with the patients’ insurance to avoid any unexpected costs on their end. If you need specific patient details, I can forward them securely.

Also, I’ll be on leave from October 23rd to 27th for a professional development workshop. It would be great to resolve this before I leave, if possible.

Looking forward to your insights.

Best regards,

Hi Tabitha,

Thanks for bringing this to my attention. I’ve reviewed some preliminary data on Blueline Health's coverage policies and noticed that there might be nuances in their plans that could affect therapy services. I’ll dig deeper into the specifics and liaise with our contact at Blueline to get the most accurate information.

Regarding your timeline, I’ll prioritize this and aim to have a detailed response by the end of the week. We understand the importance of ensuring seamless patient experiences, and I’ll do my best to expedite the process.

Enjoy your upcoming workshop! Feel free to reach out if there are any other pressing matters before your leave.

Best,
