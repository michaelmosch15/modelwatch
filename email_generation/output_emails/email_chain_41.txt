Hi Troy,

I hope this email finds you well. I'm currently drafting the narrative for our upcoming product launch, focusing on the new antiviral medication. In order to ensure that the financial aspects are accurately portrayed, could you take a look at the budget allocation I've attached?

We need to make sure that the figures align with the projected spending and strategic priorities set by the marketing team. Your expertise would be invaluable in refining this section, especially since the presentation to the executive board is scheduled for October 15th.

Please let me know if you have any questions or need further information. I’m aiming to finalize the draft by next Tuesday. I’ll be working from the office at Cambridge this week, so feel free to drop by my desk or call me at (555) 782-3498.

Thank you so much for your help!

Best,  
Cheyenne

Hi Cheyenne,

Thanks for sending this over. I’ve taken a preliminary look at the budget allocation, and it seems quite thorough. However, I noticed that the estimated costs for digital marketing seem slightly on the higher side compared to our previous launches. I’ll adjust those figures based on the latest projections and get back to you by end of day tomorrow.

Also, make sure to account for the potential increase in costs due to the currency fluctuation we’ve been experiencing lately. This could impact our international distribution expenses.

I'll be out of the office this Friday for a family commitment, but reachable by email. Let me know if there's anything urgent before then.

Speak soon,  
Troy
