Hi Melinda,

I hope this email finds you well. I am reaching out to discuss the upcoming expansion of our biopharmaceutical manufacturing facility in Rahway. As you might be aware, this project is critical to increasing our production capacity to meet the growing demand for our oncology pipeline.

I wanted to touch base with you regarding the civil engineering aspects, specifically in relation to the new cleanroom spaces and HVAC system upgrades. Since your team has extensive experience in consulting for similar projects, your insights would be invaluable.

Could we schedule a meeting this week to go over the project timelines and any preliminary assessments your team might have? I am available on Thursday after 2 PM or Friday morning. Let me know what works best for you.

Looking forward to collaborating closely on this.

Best,

Hi Cristian,

Thanks for reaching out. I appreciate the heads-up on this project. The expansion at Rahway sounds like a significant endeavor, and I’m eager to contribute to its success.

I’ll ensure to bring our top consultants on board to streamline the integration of the new cleanroom facilities with the existing infrastructure. Regarding the HVAC system, we have some innovative solutions in mind that could enhance energy efficiency while maintaining compliance with all necessary regulations.

Thursday after 2 PM works perfectly for me. Let's meet in my office, Bldg. C, Room 204. If there are any specific documents or data you’d like us to review beforehand, feel free to send them my way.

Looking forward to our discussion.

Best regards,

P.S. I’ll be on leave from the 23rd to the 27th of October, so it would be great to finalize the preliminary plans before then.
