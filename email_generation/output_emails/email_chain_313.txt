**Subject:** Collaboration Opportunity: Veterans Support Initiative  

Hi Shelly,

I hope this message finds you well. I wanted to touch base regarding a potential collaboration opportunity that could align well with your work in Armed Forces Training and Education. Given Merck's ongoing commitment to supporting veterans, we are exploring the idea of launching a new initiative focused on providing pharmaceutical education and resources to veterans transitioning into civilian life.

Our team is in the early stages of planning a charity fundraiser scheduled for November 15th at our Rahway campus to kickstart this initiative. We believe that your expertise and connections with veterans' organizations could be invaluable in shaping the scope and impact of this project.

Would you be available for a quick call next week to discuss this further? Please let me know your availability. I’m at +1 (732) 555-0199, or you can drop by my office anytime—I’m in Building C, Room 402.

Looking forward to your thoughts.

Best regards,  
Sergio Gates  
Charity Fundraiser

Hi Sergio,

Thank you for reaching out with this exciting opportunity! It sounds like a fantastic initiative that truly aligns with Merck's values and my work with veterans. I am definitely interested in collaborating and can see several ways we could integrate educational sessions on pharmaceutical care into our existing programs for veterans.

I am available for a call next Wednesday at 2 PM, if that works for you. Alternatively, we could meet in person at your office—I do enjoy a good excuse to visit the Rahway campus! Either way, I’m eager to hear more about your ideas and discuss how we can make this initiative a success.

Please let me know what works best for you.

Best,  
Shelly Mejia  
Armed Forces Training and Education Officer
