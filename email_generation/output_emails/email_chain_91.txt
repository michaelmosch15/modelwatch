Hi Jerry,

I hope this email finds you well. I wanted to touch base regarding the insurance coverage for the video production project you mentioned last week. Given the scale of the project and its importance in our Q4 marketing strategy, it’s crucial that we ensure adequate coverage for both the equipment and the team involved.

Could you please provide me with some additional details about the locations you’ll be filming at, and the duration of the shoots? This will help me tailor the insurance package to our specific needs. If possible, could you send this over by Friday, October 13th? 

Also, if you’re available, let’s schedule a call later this week to discuss this further. I’m generally free on Thursday afternoon. You can reach me at my office number: (908) 555-0147. 

Looking forward to your response.

Best regards,

Hi Lauren,

Thanks for reaching out. I’m currently finalizing some of the project details, but I can provide you with what I have so far. We’re planning to shoot at three different locations: our Kenilworth headquarters, a partner lab in Cambridge, and a public health seminar in San Francisco. The filming is set to take place over the course of two weeks, starting October 23rd.

I’ll gather the remaining information and send it your way by Friday as requested. Thursday afternoon works for me to discuss further. Let’s say 3 PM? I'll call you at the number you provided.

On a side note, I’ll be on leave the first week of November, so I’d like to ensure everything’s in place before then.

Thanks for your help with this!

Best,
