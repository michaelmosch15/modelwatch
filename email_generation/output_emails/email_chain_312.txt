Hi Christian,

I hope this message finds you well. I’m reaching out to discuss potential improvements in energy efficiency for the animal research facility at our Rahway site. Given the emphasis on sustainability in our recent corporate strategy meetings, I believe there’s a significant opportunity to reduce our energy footprint while maintaining optimal conditions for our animal care protocols.

We’re currently assessing the HVAC systems, and I’d appreciate your insights on any specific requirements the animals might have that could influence our approach. Additionally, if there are any upcoming changes in your protocols or facility usage, that information would be invaluable as we draft our initial proposals.

Could we schedule a time next week to discuss this in more detail? I’m available Monday and Wednesday after 2 PM. Feel free to suggest any other time that might work better for you.

Looking forward to collaborating on this important initiative.

Best regards,

Hi Kayla,

Thanks for reaching out. I agree that optimizing our energy use is crucial, especially with the upcoming expansion of our breeding programs. The HVAC systems are indeed a significant area where we could make improvements, considering they run continuously to maintain controlled environments.

Regarding the animal care protocols, maintaining stable temperatures and humidity levels is critical, especially for our rodent models. I can share the detailed requirements and any upcoming changes before our meeting.

Next week, Wednesday at 3 PM works perfectly for me. Let’s meet in conference room B on the second floor, if that suits you. If there's anything specific you need me to prepare or bring along, just let me know.

Thanks again for spearheading this initiative. I’m looking forward to our discussion.

Best,
