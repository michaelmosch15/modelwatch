Hi Gavin,

I hope this email finds you well. As we gear up for the upcoming International Pharma Conference scheduled in Boston from November 5-7, I wanted to touch base regarding the travel arrangements for Dr. Stevenson and his team.

Could you please confirm the final list of attendees from the Medical Affairs department by the end of this week? This will allow us to finalize the necessary flight and accommodation bookings in a timely manner.

Additionally, if there are any specific preferences or requirements for the team—dietary restrictions, accessibility needs, etc.—please let me know so we can ensure a seamless experience.

Feel free to reach out via phone at (555) 123-4567 if you need to discuss any details further.

Looking forward to your prompt response.

Best regards,  
Joan Dickson

Hi Joan,

Thank you for reaching out. I’m in the process of finalizing the list of attendees and will have it ready for you by this Friday, October 20. As of now, we have confirmed Dr. Stevenson and three other members from his team. I’ll include any additional details regarding preferences or requirements in my follow-up email.

Please note that I will be out of the office from October 25-30 for personal leave. During this time, you can contact Lisa Nguyen at lisanguyen@example.com for any urgent matters related to this conference.

Thanks for your assistance in organizing this. I’ll be in touch soon with the finalized details.

Best,
