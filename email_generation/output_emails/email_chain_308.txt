Hi Jillian,

I hope this message finds you well. I'm reaching out to discuss the upcoming Community Health Initiative that Merck is sponsoring in collaboration with local health services. Given your expertise as an Aid Worker, your insights would be invaluable as we aim to tailor our adult guidance programs to better serve the community's needs.

I propose we schedule a meeting next week to align our objectives and resources. I am available on Tuesday and Thursday morning. Please let me know if any of those times work for you, or feel free to suggest an alternative.

Additionally, I wanted to ensure we incorporate any lessons learned from the recent outreach project we worked on. I'll bring the feedback report from that project to our meeting for reference.

Looking forward to collaborating on this important initiative!

Best regards,

Caroline Hickman

Hi Caroline,

Thanks for reaching out! I’m excited to be a part of the Community Health Initiative. Your idea to incorporate feedback from our recent outreach project is spot-on, as it will provide a solid foundation for our strategies.

I'm available Thursday morning for a meeting. Let's aim for 10 AM. We can meet at my office in Building 5, Room 204. I’ll also prepare some preliminary ideas on resource allocation and community engagement strategies.

Also, just a heads up, I’ll be on leave from October 15th to 20th, so I’d like to get as much groundwork done beforehand.

Looking forward to our collaborative efforts making a real difference!

Best,
