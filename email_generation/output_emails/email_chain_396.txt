**Subject:** Collaboration on Upcoming Exhibit Launch  

Hi Mariah,

I hope this message finds you well. I'm reaching out to discuss the upcoming exhibit launch we're planning for the new Pharmaceutical Innovations Gallery, scheduled for March 15th. 

Given your expertise in managing stage performances and events, I believe your insights could be invaluable as we conceptualize the interactive components of the exhibit. We aim to create a dynamic, engaging experience that effectively communicates Merck's latest breakthroughs in oncology and virology.

Could we schedule a meeting next week to brainstorm some ideas? I'm available Tuesday or Thursday afternoon, and we can meet in my office at the Main Campus, Room 204. Please let me know what works best for you.

Looking forward to your creative input!

Best,

Hi Kylie,

Thanks for reaching out! The exhibit launch sounds like a fantastic project, and I'm excited to contribute. I have some preliminary ideas on integrating multimedia elements that could enhance visitor engagement.

I'm available for a meeting on Thursday afternoon. Let's plan for 2 PM at your office. I'll bring along some sketches and a few examples from past projects that might inspire our collaboration.

By the way, I'll be on leave from March 20th to April 5th, so let's aim to finalize any crucial decisions before then.

Looking forward to our meeting!

Warm regards,
