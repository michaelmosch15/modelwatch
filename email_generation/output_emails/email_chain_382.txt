**Subject:** Budget Allocation for Q4 Communication Projects  

Hi Jean,

I hope this email finds you well. As we are finalizing the budgets for Q4, I wanted to touch base regarding the allocation for our upcoming communication infrastructure projects. Specifically, we're looking at enhancements to our internal messaging systems, which are crucial for maintaining seamless information flow during our product rollout phases.

Could you provide any insights into the financial flexibility we might have for these enhancements? I need to ensure we align our project scope with the available budget. If possible, can we set up a brief call this week to discuss this? I'm available on Wednesday and Thursday afternoon.

Also, just a quick note that I will be on leave the first week of November, so it would be great to get this squared away before then.

Thank you for your assistance!

Best,

Hi Loretta,

Thanks for reaching out. I understand the importance of these communication enhancements, especially with the product launches on the horizon. We do have some flexibility in the budget, but it will depend on the final approval from the upper management team.

Let's schedule a call to go over the specifics. I have some time available on Thursday afternoon at 3 PM, does that work for you? Given your upcoming leave, it would be ideal to finalize the details as soon as possible.

Looking forward to our discussion.

Best regards,
