Hi Ana,

I hope this message finds you well. As the date for our "Innovation in Pharmaceuticals" exhibition approaches on October 25th, I wanted to touch base regarding the catering services for the event. Given that the exhibition is set to showcase some of our groundbreaking advancements, we want to ensure the dining experience complements the high caliber of our presentation.

Could you confirm the number of attendees expected, so we can tailor the menu accordingly? Additionally, if there are any dietary restrictions or particular preferences we should be aware of, please let me know by the end of this week. Our team is eager to provide a seamless dining experience that will leave a lasting impression on our guests.

Feel free to call me directly at (555) 123-4567 if you’d like to discuss any details over the phone.

Looking forward to collaborating with you on this exciting event!

Best regards,

Hi Cindy,

Thank you for reaching out. I’m thrilled about the exhibition and appreciate your proactive approach to ensuring everything runs smoothly.

We are expecting approximately 150 attendees, including some of our international partners. I’ll compile a list of any dietary restrictions and preferences from our RSVP responses and aim to send it your way by this Thursday. Please keep in mind that we’ll have several guests who prefer vegetarian options, so a diverse menu would be ideal.

If you need any additional information or adjustments closer to the event, feel free to contact me. I’m currently stationed at our Newark office, but I’ll have my mobile on hand at (555) 987-6543.

Thanks again for your support, and I look forward to a successful event!

Warm regards,
