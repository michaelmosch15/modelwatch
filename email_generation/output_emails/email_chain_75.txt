Hi Jeremiah,

I hope this message finds you well. I'm reaching out to discuss the upcoming project on enhancing the English proficiency of our IT department, as part of Merck's global initiative to streamline communication across all branches.

As you know, effective communication is crucial for our team, especially when collaborating on projects like the new PharmaTech application. We aim to ensure that everyone can articulate technical concepts clearly and efficiently.

Could we schedule a meeting to discuss integrating specific software engineering terminologies and scenarios into your training modules? Perhaps next Tuesday, October 17th, at 2 PM? Let me know if this works for you or if there's a more convenient time.

Looking forward to your input.

Best regards,

Hi Cassie,

Thank you for reaching out. I completely agree that enhancing English proficiency within the IT team is vital, especially with the new initiatives we have in place. I'm excited about the opportunity to tailor the EFL training modules specifically for the technical staff.

Next Tuesday at 2 PM works perfectly for me. We can use the conference room on the 4th floor of Building B. I'll prepare some initial ideas on incorporating tech-specific language and situational exercises based on real-life project scenarios, such as the PharmaTech application you mentioned.

Please feel free to send any additional topics or areas you believe should be emphasized in the training. Looking forward to our collaboration!

Best,
