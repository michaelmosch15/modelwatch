Subject: Coordination on the Drilling Equipment Installation Timeline

Hi Kristi,

I hope this email finds you well. I am reaching out regarding the upcoming installation of the new drilling equipment at our Westfield site. We are scheduled to commence the setup on April 3, and I wanted to ensure everything is in place for a smooth operation.

Could you confirm if all necessary environmental compliance checks have been completed? I believe you were coordinating with the local authorities on this. Additionally, if there are any pending concerns or documentation required from our end, please let me know by next Friday, March 17, so we can address them promptly.

Looking forward to your confirmation.

Best regards,

Hi Erik,

Thank you for reaching out and for the information on the installation timeline. I have confirmed with the environmental compliance team, and all necessary checks have been completed. We have the green light from the local authorities, so there shouldn’t be any delays from our side.

Regarding documentation, I believe everything is in order, but I'll double-check and get back to you by Thursday, March 16, just to be sure. Please let me know if there is anything specific you require.

By the way, I’ll be on leave from March 20 to March 24, so if you need any urgent assistance during that time, please contact my colleague, Sarah Jensen, at sjensen@example.com.

Thank you again, and I look forward to a successful project launch.

Best,
