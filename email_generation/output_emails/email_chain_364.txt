**Subject:** Collaboration on Upcoming Diagnostic Marketing Campaign  

Hi Anna,

I hope this email finds you well. I wanted to reach out regarding the upcoming marketing campaign for our new diagnostic imaging solutions. Given your expertise in outreach and your background in tourism, I believe your insights could greatly enhance our campaign strategy, especially in terms of engaging potential clients and stakeholders.

Our team is currently in the initial planning stages. We're focusing on how best to highlight the advanced features of our imaging technologies and their impact on patient outcomes. I think your experience in curating engaging content could be invaluable here. Could we perhaps schedule a meeting next week to discuss this further? My calendar is pretty flexible, so let me know what works for you.

Additionally, I'll be out of the office from October 20-25 for a conference in Chicago, so it would be great to touch base before then.

Looking forward to your thoughts.

Best,

Hi Cory,

Thanks for reaching out! I’m excited about the opportunity to collaborate on the diagnostic imaging solutions campaign. Your idea to leverage tourism-style engagement strategies is intriguing, and I believe it could bring a fresh perspective to our outreach efforts.

I’m available for a meeting next Tuesday or Thursday. How about Tuesday at 10 AM? We can meet in the conference room on the 3rd floor, unless you have another preference.

Also, I’ll make sure to prepare some initial ideas on potential partnerships and event concepts that could align with your objectives. Safe travels to Chicago, and let’s aim to have a solid plan before your trip.

Looking forward to our collaboration!

Best regards,
