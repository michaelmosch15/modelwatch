Subject: Collaboration on Energy Efficiency for Upcoming Lab Upgrades

Hi Kelli,

I hope this message finds you well. I wanted to reach out regarding the upcoming lab upgrades slated for Q1 2024, particularly focusing on enhancing our energy efficiency. As you know, our team has been tasked with developing more sustainable physiological testing methods, and energy consumption is a critical part of that initiative.

Given your expertise in energy systems, I think your insights would be invaluable in ensuring our new equipment aligns with Merck's sustainability goals. Could we schedule a meeting to discuss potential strategies? I’m available next week on Tuesday or Thursday afternoon. Please let me know your availability.

Looking forward to your thoughts.

Best,

Hi Cindy,

Thanks for reaching out. I'm glad to hear that energy efficiency is a priority for the new lab upgrades. It's crucial we align with Merck's commitment to reducing our carbon footprint while maintaining high standards of research quality.

I’ve reviewed the preliminary plans, and I think we can implement some innovative energy-saving technologies, especially in HVAC systems and lighting. I’m available for a meeting on Thursday afternoon next week. Would 2 PM work for you? We can meet in Conference Room 3B.

Let me know if that time suits you, and we can dive into the details. Looking forward to collaborating on this exciting project.

Best regards,

Hi Kelli,

2 PM on Thursday works perfectly for me. Conference Room 3B it is. I’ll bring the latest data from our physiological processes so we can pinpoint exactly where we can cut down on energy use without compromising our operations.

Thanks for jumping on board with this. I’m confident that with your expertise, we can make significant strides toward a more sustainable lab environment.

See you next week!
