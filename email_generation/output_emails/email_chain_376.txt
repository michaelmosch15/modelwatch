Hi Sherry,

I hope this message finds you well. I wanted to touch base regarding the Q3 investment strategy review we discussed last month. As you know, the focus is on optimizing our operational efficiencies, particularly within the supply chain for our fast food portfolio.

Given Merck's ongoing initiatives to enhance health and wellness through strategic partnerships, it would be beneficial to align our investment strategy with our core pharmaceutical innovations. Could you provide insights on potential collaborative opportunities with health-focused fast food chains? A few names like Freshii and Sweetgreen come to mind, but I would love your expertise to expand on this.

Let’s aim to schedule a meeting next week to brainstorm this further. I’m flexible with timings, but preferably before I leave for the Chicago conference on October 15th. Feel free to suggest a time that works for you.

Looking forward to your thoughts.

Best regards,

Hi Tara,

Thanks for reaching out. I completely agree that aligning our investment strategy with Merck's health-centric approach is crucial. I’ve been looking into several fast food chains that are pivoting towards healthier options, and I think Sweetgreen and Freshii are excellent starting points. Another potential partner could be Panera Bread, given their recent efforts in offering more balanced meal options.

I’m available for a meeting next Wednesday or Thursday. How does Wednesday at 2 PM sound? We can use the conference room on the 12th floor. Let me know if that works for you, or if there’s another time that suits you better.

Also, safe travels to Chicago! It sounds like an exciting conference. Let's ensure we have everything wrapped up before you head out.

Best,
