**Subject:** Budget Allocation for Mental Health Awareness Initiative  

Hi Jaime,

I hope this message finds you well. As we gear up for the Mental Health Awareness Initiative slated for Q1 2024, I wanted to touch base regarding the budget allocation for your department's workshops and counseling sessions. Given the success of last year's program, we are anticipating a 15% increase in participation, which will inevitably impact our financial planning.

Could you provide a detailed estimate of your projected costs by the end of next week? This will allow me to make the necessary adjustments in our quarterly financial reports. Also, if you have any new program ideas that might require additional funding, this would be the perfect time to discuss them.

Feel free to give me a call at 555-0199 if you want to go over anything in detail. I'm in the office for the rest of the week but will be on leave from October 16th to 20th.

Looking forward to your insights.

Best,  
Sara

Hi Sara,

Thank you for reaching out. I’ll compile the cost estimates and send them your way by next Wednesday. Considering the increased engagement, I’m proposing we expand our virtual counseling sessions to accommodate more employees, especially those in remote locations. This would require a modest increase in our digital platform subscription fees.

Additionally, I’m exploring a partnership with a leading mental health app to offer premium features as part of our employee wellness package. I’ll include these details in the proposal as well.

I’ll make sure to have everything ready before your leave, but let’s schedule a quick call on Friday to finalize any urgent matters. I’ll reach out at 3 PM if that works for you.

Thank you for your support on this initiative. It’s greatly appreciated.

Warm regards,  
Jaime
