Hi Mike,

I hope this email finds you well. I'm reaching out to discuss an exciting project we're working on—the upcoming exhibition at our gallery focusing on innovations in pharmaceuticals, specifically highlighting the intersection of science and art.

Given your expertise in physiological sciences, I believe your insights would be invaluable in curating a section dedicated to the groundbreaking research and developments from Merck. We aim to showcase not only the scientific achievements but also the journey of these innovations, from conception to clinical application.

Could we arrange a time this week to discuss potential collaboration and your availability for a brief walkthrough of the exhibition space? I’m in the office Monday through Thursday, and we can meet either virtually or at the gallery. 

Looking forward to your thoughts.

Best regards,

Hi Angelica,

Thanks for reaching out. The exhibition sounds like a fantastic initiative, and I’d be delighted to contribute. Merging science and art is a great way to engage a broader audience and highlight the innovation within our industry.

I’m available this Thursday afternoon for a walkthrough. Could we meet at 3 PM at the gallery? That should give us enough time to go through the details and brainstorm ideas for the exhibition's layout and content.

Also, I noticed that some of my colleagues from the R&D department might have some compelling visual data we could incorporate. I’ll reach out to them in advance to see what they can share.

Looking forward to our collaboration.

Best,

P.S. I’ll be out of the office next week for a conference, so let’s aim to finalize the details before then.
