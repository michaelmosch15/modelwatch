**Subject:** Patent Database Access Issue  

Hi Jessica,

I hope you had a great weekend!

I'm reaching out because we've been experiencing some access issues with the patent database that might affect your upcoming evaluations. It seems like the system is intermittently denying access, and I've received a few reports from other departments as well.

Our IT team is investigating the root cause, and we hope to have a resolution soon. In the meantime, if there are any specific patent files you urgently need, please let me know. I can coordinate with our backend team to provide you temporary access or retrieve the files manually.

Also, just a quick reminder that I'll be on leave from October 12-16 for a family event. Please feel free to connect with my colleague, Tom Miller, during that period if you need immediate assistance.

Best,

Hi Kristina,

Thank you for the heads up. I did notice some trouble accessing the database this morning, so your email is quite timely. I have a couple of critical patent evaluations due this week, specifically those related to our recent oncology research. If you could prioritize those, it would be greatly appreciated.

I'll make sure to note your upcoming leave and will reach out to Tom if anything comes up during that period. Enjoy your time with your family!

Thanks again for your support.

Best,
