Hi Katie,

I hope this email finds you well. I’m reaching out to discuss a potential collaboration between our teams that could be mutually beneficial. We are planning a radio segment focused on the latest innovations in the pharmaceutical industry, and I believe featuring a piece from your magazine could provide a comprehensive perspective for our audience.

Given Merck's recent developments in oncology and vaccine research, I think this is a prime opportunity to highlight these advancements. It would be great to coordinate on content and ensure we’re both delivering high-quality, insightful information.

Could we schedule a call later this week to brainstorm ideas? I'm available Thursday and Friday afternoon. Please let me know what works best for you. Looking forward to your thoughts.

Best regards,

Hi Alexandra,

Thanks for reaching out. Your proposal sounds intriguing, and I agree that a collaboration could enrich both our projects. The intersection of radio and print media could bring a dynamic aspect to how we present these pharmaceutical breakthroughs.

I’d be delighted to discuss this further. Thursday afternoon works perfectly for me. How about 3 PM? We can use the conference line or meet in my office—whichever you prefer. My office is located on the 5th floor of the main building if you decide to come over.

Also, just a heads-up, I’ll be on leave from October 20th through the 30th, so if we can get the ball rolling before then, it would be ideal. Looking forward to our conversation.

Warm regards,
