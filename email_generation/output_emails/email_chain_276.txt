Hi Kristina,

I hope this message finds you well. I wanted to touch base regarding the stress management workshop we're developing for the engineering teams. Given your expertise in aeronautical engineering and your team's involvement in the high-stakes projects, I believe your insights would be invaluable.

The workshop aims to address the unique pressures faced by engineers working on high-impact projects, like the recent advancements in our aerospace division. We're focusing on strategies that foster resilience and enhance performance under pressure.

Could we schedule a time to discuss this further? I think your perspective on the kinds of stressors your team encounters would be a great asset to tailoring our approach. I'm available for a call this Thursday or Friday afternoon. Let me know what works for you.

Looking forward to collaborating.

Best,

Hi Brent,

Thanks for reaching out, and I’m glad to hear about the initiative. Stress management is indeed crucial, especially with our upcoming launch of the new aerospace project next quarter. The team’s commitment is unwavering, but the pressure is palpable.

I would be more than happy to contribute. Thursday afternoon works perfectly for me. How about 3 PM? We can meet at my office in Building 4, Room 212, or I can join a call if that’s more convenient for you.

Looking forward to our discussion and finding ways to help our teams thrive under pressure.

Best regards,

P.S. I’ll be on leave from September 25th, so it would be great to finalize any inputs before then.
