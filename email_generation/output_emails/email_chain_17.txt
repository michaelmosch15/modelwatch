**Subject:** Collaboration on Radiation Safety Protocols  

Hi Levi,

I hope this message finds you well. I’m reaching out to discuss a potential collaboration between our departments to enhance the radiation safety protocols in the new clinical study that involves radioisotope-based therapies.

Given your expertise in acupuncture and its complementary role in patient care, I believe we could develop a comprehensive safety framework that not only addresses the technical aspects but also considers patient well-being from a holistic perspective. Your insights into managing patient stress and promoting recovery could be extremely beneficial.

Could we schedule a meeting to discuss this further? I’m available this Thursday or Friday after 2 PM. Let me know what works best for you. Additionally, I’ll be out of the office next week for a conference in Geneva, so it would be great to touch base before then.

Looking forward to your thoughts.

Best,

Hi Alexa,

Thank you for reaching out. I’m glad to hear about this initiative, and I agree that a collaborative approach could be highly beneficial for our patients. Integrating acupuncture and radiation safety protocols is an interesting concept that I’d love to explore further.

I’m available this Thursday at 3 PM, which should give us ample time to delve into the details. We can meet in Conference Room B on the 8th floor, if that works for you.

Safe travels to Geneva next week, and I’m looking forward to our meeting. Let me know if there’s anything specific you’d like me to prepare ahead of time.

Warm regards,
