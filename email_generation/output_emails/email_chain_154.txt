**Subject:** Coordination on Vivarium HVAC Adjustments

Hi Julian,

I hope this message finds you well. I’m reaching out regarding the ongoing adjustments to the HVAC system in the vivarium area. As you know, maintaining optimal temperature and humidity levels is crucial for the reptilian specimens, especially with the new batch arriving next week.

We’ve been analyzing the current settings and noticed some fluctuations that might impact the controlled environment needed for your studies. To address this, I propose a meeting to discuss potential adjustments. Could we schedule a time this Thursday, perhaps around 3 PM, to go over the system specifications and your requirements? I’ll be in the office at Building 4, Room 312, all day, so I can accommodate any time that suits you.

Please let me know your availability or if there’s anyone else from your team who should join the discussion.

Looking forward to our collaboration on this.

Best,

Hi Sherri,

Thank you for reaching out. I completely agree that we need to address the HVAC issues before the new specimens arrive. Thursday at 3 PM works perfectly for me. I’ll bring along some data logs so we can pinpoint the exact times and conditions where fluctuations have occurred.

Additionally, I’ll invite Dr. Emily Tran from my team, as she’s been closely monitoring the environmental conditions and could provide further insights into the specific needs of the new species we’re working with.

Looking forward to our meeting. Thank you for your proactive approach to this matter.

Best regards,
