Hi Shirley,

I hope this message finds you well. I wanted to touch base regarding our ongoing enzyme inhibitor project. As you know, we're in the critical phase of analyzing the latest batch of biochemical assays. The preliminary data shows promising inhibitory effects, but there are some outliers that need further investigation.

Could we schedule a meeting to discuss the methodology we're using for these assays? I believe a detailed review could help us identify any inconsistencies early on. I’m available Thursday afternoon or Friday morning if that works for you.

Also, as an FYI, I’ll be on leave from October 30th to November 3rd, so I’d like to ensure we’re on the same page before I’m out.

Looking forward to your thoughts.

Best regards,

Hi Tracey,

Thanks for reaching out. I reviewed the initial batch of data, and I agree that a deeper dive into the outliers is necessary. A meeting sounds like a great idea; let’s aim for Thursday at 2 PM. I’ll secure a conference room in Building 5, so we can spread out any documentation we need to go through.

Regarding your upcoming leave, I’ll make sure we cover all necessary ground before then. I’ll also coordinate with the rest of the team to ensure continuity in your absence.

Let me know if Thursday works for you, and I’ll send out a calendar invite.

Best,
