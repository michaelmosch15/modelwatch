Hi Destiny,

I hope this message finds you well. I'm reaching out to discuss our upcoming presentation at the PharmaTech Innovations Conference next month. As the communication engineer responsible for the technical setup, I want to ensure everything runs smoothly for your session on "The Evolution of Theatrical Techniques in Pharma Training."

Could you confirm the final list of equipment you'll need? I have us down for the standard AV setup, but if there are any specific requirements or interactive elements you plan to include, we'll need to align with the AV team by October 20th. Also, please let me know if you have any preferences for the rehearsal schedule.

On a separate note, I'll be on leave from October 25th to 28th for a family commitment, so I'd like to finalize everything well in advance. Feel free to reach me at my direct line (555-0123) if there are any urgent matters.

Looking forward to collaborating on this.

Best regards,  
Craig Cervantes  
Communications Engineer

Hi Craig,

Thanks for reaching out. I'm excited about the conference and appreciate your help in ensuring the presentation goes off without a hitch. The standard AV setup should suffice, but I'll be incorporating some live polling elements via our digital engagement platform. Could you check if we have the necessary connectivity to support this?

Regarding the rehearsal, I propose we schedule it for October 23rd, around 3 PM, if that fits your calendar. This should give us ample time to make any adjustments before your leave.

Thank you for the proactive coordination. I'll make sure to have everything finalized by October 20th as requested. I'll keep your direct line handy just in case anything comes up.

Best,  
Destiny Pugh
