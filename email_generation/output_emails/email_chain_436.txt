Hi Sonia,

I hope this message finds you well. As you know, we are moving forward with the office renovation project for the Merck Research Center in Rahway. We are scheduled to kick off the initial phase next month.

I wanted to touch base with you regarding the design elements for the new collaborative workspaces and breakout areas. Your expertise in creating functional yet inspiring environments will be crucial. Could we set up a time next week to go over the initial design concepts? I’m particularly interested in your thoughts on integrating sustainable materials, as this has become a key focus for us.

Please let me know your availability. Also, if you have any preliminary sketches or ideas, feel free to share them ahead of our meeting.

Looking forward to collaborating on this exciting project!

Best,

Hi Theresa,

Thanks for reaching out! I'm thrilled to be part of the Rahway office renovation project. I agree that focusing on sustainable materials is a fantastic direction. I've been researching some eco-friendly options that could work well for high-traffic areas and maintain the aesthetic we're aiming for.

I'm available for a meeting on Tuesday, October 17th, at 2 PM. Does that work for you? I'll prepare a few sketches and mood boards to discuss during our session. I'll also bring samples of some green materials I've sourced that might be a good fit.

Looking forward to our collaboration and bringing fresh energy to our workspaces!

Best regards,
