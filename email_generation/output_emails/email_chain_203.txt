**Subject:** Request for Video Edits on Compliance Training Module  

Hi Nicole,

I hope this email finds you well. I’m reaching out to discuss the video content for the new compliance training module we’re working on for the rural practice division.

I've completed the initial surveys with our field staff, and we've gathered some insightful data that highlights the need for a more engaging training approach. Given your expertise, I believe you can help us create compelling video content that aligns with our objectives.

Could you integrate the survey results into the visual narrative? I think it would be effective to use animated infographics to represent the data. Let me know your thoughts, and if you can get the first draft ready by October 20th, that would be fantastic. Also, I’d like to schedule a meeting to discuss this further. I'm available this Friday after 2 PM. Does that work for you?

Looking forward to your creative input!

Best,

Hi Jodi,

Thanks for reaching out. It sounds like an exciting project, and I’d be happy to assist. Integrating survey data with animated infographics is a great idea—I think it will definitely enhance engagement for the training module.

I can start working on the draft and aim to have something ready by the 20th. Let’s definitely meet to discuss the specifics. This Friday after 2 PM works perfectly for me. I'll send over a calendar invite shortly.

On a side note, I’ll be on leave starting October 25th, so I’ll make sure everything is in place before then. Let’s ensure we nail down any revisions before my break.

Looking forward to collaborating on this!
