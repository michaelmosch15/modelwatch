Subject: Coordination on Upcoming Mineral Survey Project

Hi Mackenzie,

I hope this message finds you well. As we gear up for the mineral assessment scheduled for November 15, I wanted to touch base regarding some logistical aspects that may intersect with your team's upcoming initiatives.

Given the scale of this project, we'll need to ensure that our pension scheme is appropriately adjusted to reflect the increased temporary workforce required. It would be great to align on how these adjustments might impact our budget forecasts and any impending audits.

Could we schedule a brief call this week to discuss this in detail? I'm available on Thursday and Friday between 2-4 PM EST. Please let me know what works best for you, or feel free to propose another time.

Looking forward to your insights.

Best regards,

Re: Coordination on Upcoming Mineral Survey Project

Hi Katrina,

Thanks for reaching out. I agree, it's crucial for us to synchronize our efforts, especially with the anticipated influx of personnel for the mineral survey.

I can make myself available for a call on Thursday at 3 PM EST. We'll discuss the necessary adjustments to the pension plan and any related budgetary considerations. I'll also bring our latest projections so we can align them with your project timelines.

Additionally, I'll be on leave from October 20-27, so if there are any follow-ups required, let’s aim to address them before then.

Looking forward to our discussion.

Best,
