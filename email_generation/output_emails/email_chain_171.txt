Hi Abigail,

I hope this message finds you well. I'm reaching out regarding the upcoming project on optimizing our protective garment supply chain for the new pharmaceutical production line in Kenilworth.

As you're aware, ensuring we have a robust logistics framework in place is critical to meet the launch timelines. Given your expertise in logistics and support, I believe your insights will be invaluable. Specifically, we need to coordinate on the delivery schedules and inventory management to ensure seamless integration with the production schedules.

Could we set up a time this week to discuss the draft plan? I'm available Thursday and Friday this week between 10 AM and 2 PM. Please let me know what works for you.

Looking forward to collaborating on this.

Best regards,

Hi Walter,

Thank you for reaching out. It's great to hear that the project is moving forward. I completely agree that aligning our logistics strategy with production is key to a successful launch. I'll make sure to bring the latest updates on inventory levels and transit times so we can plan effectively.

I am available on Thursday at 11 AM, which should give us ample time to cover all the necessary details. Let's meet in Conference Room B at the Kenilworth office. Does that work for you?

Also, a heads-up: I will be on leave starting next Wednesday for a week, so it would be great to finalize the initial strategy before then.

Looking forward to our meeting.

Best,
