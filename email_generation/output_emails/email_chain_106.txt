Subject: Request for Collaboration on Patent Visuals

---

Hi Brett,

I hope this message finds you well. I am reaching out regarding the recent patent application for our innovative drug delivery system. As you might be aware, we’re in the process of finalizing the submission, and I believe your expertise in multimedia design could significantly enhance our patent documents with detailed visuals that clearly convey the mechanism and advantages of our technology.

Could we schedule a meeting to discuss this? I’m aiming to have the draft ready by next Friday, October 20th, so your input would be invaluable over the next week. Let me know your availability for a quick call or an in-person brainstorming session in my office at HQ, Room 543.

Looking forward to your insights.

Best regards,

Henry Santiago

Hi Henry,

Thanks for reaching out. I’d be delighted to help with the visuals for the patent application. I completely agree that clear and compelling visuals are crucial for conveying the intricacies of our drug delivery system.

I’m available for a meeting this Thursday, October 12th, anytime between 10 AM and 2 PM. We can meet in your office or, if you prefer, I can set up a Zoom call. Let me know what works best for you.

Looking forward to collaborating on this project. Also, just a heads-up, I’ll be on leave starting October 23rd for a week, so I’d like to wrap this up before then.

Best,
