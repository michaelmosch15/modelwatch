Hi Glen,

I hope this message finds you well. I wanted to touch base regarding the upcoming Mental Health Awareness Workshop scheduled for March 20th, which I believe you are leading. I've been exploring some phytotherapeutic approaches that could complement your art therapy sessions, particularly focusing on stress reduction and cognitive enhancement.

Given Merck's commitment to integrating innovative solutions for mental health, I think it could be beneficial to collaborate on this. We could perhaps discuss the synergy between our fields and present a joint session. Let me know if you're available for a brief meeting this week to discuss this further. I'm generally free in the afternoons, or we could arrange a quick call if that's more convenient for you.

Looking forward to your thoughts.

Best regards,

Hi Albert,

Thank you for reaching out. I think your idea of integrating phytotherapeutic approaches into the workshop is fantastic, and it would certainly add an innovative dimension to our program. I appreciate Merck's support in fostering such interdisciplinary collaborations.

I am available for a meeting this Thursday at 2 PM if that works for you. We can meet in my office on the 5th floor of the East Building. Alternatively, I'm open to a call if that better fits your schedule.

By the way, it's worth noting that I'll be on leave from February 27th to March 6th, so it would be great to finalize our plans before then.

Looking forward to our collaboration.

Best,
