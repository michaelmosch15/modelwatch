Hi Daisy,

I hope this message finds you well. As you know, we're gearing up for our Q4 training initiatives, and I wanted to touch base regarding the specific needs of our special educational needs (SEN) team at Merck. Your insights would be invaluable in tailoring our programs to better support the unique challenges faced by your department.

Could you please provide a brief overview of any specific areas your team would like to focus on in the upcoming sessions? Additionally, if there are any preferred dates for these sessions, let me know so we can ensure maximum participation.

Looking forward to your feedback. Feel free to reach out at (555) 123-4567 if you wish to discuss this in more detail.

Best regards,

Cassidy Spears  
Training and Development Officer

Hi Cassidy,

Thank you for reaching out. Our team is indeed eager to participate in the upcoming training sessions. One area we’re keen on exploring is the integration of new pharmaceutical technologies in educational settings. As you know, the use of digital tools tailored for SEN is becoming increasingly important, and our team would greatly benefit from any training related to that.

Regarding the schedule, the week of November 20th works best for us as I'll be on leave starting December 1st, and I want to ensure we have everything in place before then. Please let me know if this timeframe aligns with your plans.

I appreciate your proactive approach and am looking forward to collaborating closely on this.

Best,  
Daisy King
