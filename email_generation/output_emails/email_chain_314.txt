Hi Austin,

Thank you for reaching out about the Community Health Initiative. Your insights as a social worker are invaluable as we aim to enhance our community engagement strategies.

I understand your department is focusing on mental health support programs. It aligns perfectly with our strategic goal to expand access to mental healthcare resources. I’d like to discuss how Merck can support your efforts through our upcoming "Healthy Minds, Healthy Communities" campaign launching in Q1 2024.

Could we schedule a meeting next week to explore potential collaboration points? I'm available on Wednesday and Thursday afternoon. Let me know what works best for you. Also, if you have any preliminary data or reports, please share them ahead of our meeting.

Looking forward to your response.

Best,  
Eileen Leblanc

Hi Eileen,

Thanks for your email. I’m excited about the potential synergy between our teams. The "Healthy Minds, Healthy Communities" campaign sounds like a fantastic initiative, and I’m eager to see how we can integrate our mental health support programs.

Wednesday afternoon works for me. How about 3 PM? I’ll prepare a brief overview of our current projects and some key metrics that highlight the impact we’ve made so far. I’ll send these over by Monday.

Looking forward to a productive discussion.

Best regards,

P.S. I’ll be out of the office from October 16-20 for a family commitment, so if we need further discussions, let’s try to wrap them up before then.
