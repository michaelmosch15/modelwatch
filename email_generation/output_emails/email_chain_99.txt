**Subject:** Coordination for Upcoming Conference in Berlin  

Hi Judy,

I hope this message finds you well. As we prepare for the upcoming International Pharmaceutical Conference in Berlin next month, I wanted to touch base with you regarding the multilingual presentation support we discussed.

I believe your expertise as an interpreter will be crucial in ensuring our European partners fully grasp the nuances of our latest research on biosimilars. Could you confirm your availability for the sessions on October 15th and 16th? We’ll need interpretation in both German and French, as these are the primary languages of the attending delegates.

Also, please let me know if there are specific materials or resources you need from my end to facilitate your preparation. I am here to assist you in any way I can to make this a seamless experience for all parties involved.

Looking forward to your reply.

Best regards,

Lucas Bowman

Hi Lucas,

Thank you for reaching out. I’m delighted to be part of the team heading to Berlin. I’ve marked my calendar for October 15th and 16th and will be available to provide interpretation in both German and French as requested.

To ensure everything goes smoothly, could you send over any specific terminology or research papers that will be highlighted during the presentations? Having those in advance will allow me to familiarize myself with the content and provide the most accurate interpretations.

Additionally, I’ll be out of the office from October 5th to 9th for some personal commitments, so it would be great if we could finalize the details before then. I believe our collaboration will greatly enhance communication with our European partners, and I’m excited to contribute to our shared goals.

Best,
