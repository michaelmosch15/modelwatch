Hi Nicole,

I hope this email finds you well. I wanted to touch base regarding the progress on our horticultural therapy program and the upcoming presentation to the board.

As you know, we've been working on integrating the new botanical compounds into our existing therapeutic models. The preliminary results are promising, showing significant stress reduction and improved mental wellness among participants. I believe these findings will make a substantial impact on our initiative to incorporate innovative therapies into patient care.

Could you please confirm if the board meeting is still set for October 25th at the Rahway campus? Also, can you provide any updates on the logistical arrangements for the presentation? I want to ensure everything is aligned before I finalize the slides.

Thanks so much for your assistance. Looking forward to your reply.

Best,

Hi Kristen,

Thanks for reaching out. It's great to hear about the positive outcomes from the program—definitely aligns with our goals for enhancing patient care through innovative therapies.

Regarding the board meeting, it is indeed confirmed for October 25th at the Rahway campus, starting at 10:00 AM. I've reserved Conference Room B for your presentation. Please let me know if you need any specific equipment set up or if there are additional materials you’d like us to prepare.

Also, just as a heads up, I will be on leave from October 18th to 22nd, but you can always reach out to John Lewis (john.lewis@example.org) if any urgent matters arise during that time.

Let me know if there's anything else I can assist you with before my leave.

Best regards,
