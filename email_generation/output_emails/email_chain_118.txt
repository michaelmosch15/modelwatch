**Subject:** Collaboration on Data Visualization for Upcoming Exhibition  

Hi Julian,

I hope this message finds you well. I’m reaching out to discuss an upcoming project that might benefit from your expertise in data science.

We’re in the early stages of planning an exhibition at our West Point headquarters, aimed at showcasing the intersection of pharmaceuticals and technology. Given Merck's commitment to innovation, we want to highlight our cutting-edge data analytics and its impact on drug development. I believe your insights could be invaluable in creating engaging, educational data visualizations for our visitors.

Could we schedule a time next week to brainstorm ideas? I’m available on Monday and Wednesday afternoons. Please let me know what works best for you.

Looking forward to your thoughts.

Best,

Hi Bridget,

Thanks for reaching out. Your project sounds fascinating, and I’d be thrilled to contribute. Merging data science with visual storytelling can indeed make complex information more accessible and engaging.

Monday afternoon works perfectly for me. Let’s plan to meet at 2 PM in the Innovation Lab on the 3rd floor. We can discuss potential datasets and visualization tools that could effectively communicate our research and achievements.

Also, I’ll be on leave starting November 10th for a week, so it would be great to get the groundwork laid before then.

Looking forward to our collaboration.

Best regards,
