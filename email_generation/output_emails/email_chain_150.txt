Hi Christopher,

I hope this message finds you well. As we gear up for the scheduled arboricultural activities at the Rahway site next month, I wanted to touch base regarding our emergency preparedness protocols.

Given the critical nature of the work around our facility's sensitive areas, it's imperative that we have a robust emergency response plan in place. Could we arrange a meeting to discuss the specific safety measures and any potential risks associated with the upcoming tree maintenance and removal operations? It would be great if we could integrate any specific insights you might have on environmental safety and mitigate any potential disruption to our operations.

I'm available this Thursday or Friday between 2 PM and 4 PM. Please let me know what works best for you. Also, if there are any key team members you'd recommend including in this discussion, feel free to loop them in.

Looking forward to your input.

Best regards,

Hi Patrick,

Thank you for reaching out. I completely agree that we need to ensure all safety protocols are aligned before we commence any activities at the Rahway site. Your proactive approach is much appreciated.

Thursday at 3 PM works perfectly for me. I'll bring along some preliminary risk assessments my team has conducted. Additionally, I think it would be beneficial to have Sarah Kim from the Environmental Compliance team join us, as her insights would be invaluable in this context.

I'll send out a calendar invite shortly. Let's meet in Conference Room B, as it has all the necessary AV equipment for our presentations. Let me know if there's any other documentation or data you need from my end beforehand.

Thanks again, and looking forward to collaborating on this.

Best,
