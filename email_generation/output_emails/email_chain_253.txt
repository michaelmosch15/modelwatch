Hi Stefanie,

I hope this message finds you well. I’m reaching out to discuss the upcoming Wellness Survey Project that we’re rolling out next month. As you know, this initiative is critical for assessing and enhancing the wellbeing of our team members across various locations.

Given your expertise in building evaluations, I'd love your input on how we might adapt the survey to better capture insights related to our physical work environments and their impact on psychological wellbeing. The goal is to ensure our questions are comprehensive and consider all relevant factors.

Could we schedule a meeting to discuss this further? I’m available this Thursday or Friday afternoon, anytime after 2 PM. Let me know what suits your schedule.

Looking forward to your valuable insights.

Best,

Hi Miranda,

Thank you for reaching out. I completely agree that integrating environmental insights into the Wellness Survey will provide a more holistic understanding of our team’s needs. I’m excited to contribute to this project.

Thursday afternoon works perfectly for me. Let’s plan to meet at 2:30 PM in the conference room on the third floor, if that works for you. I’ll bring along some preliminary data from our recent office space evaluations that might be useful for our discussion.

Also, just a heads up, I’ll be on leave the following week for a family commitment, so I’d like to ensure we cover as much ground as possible before then.

Looking forward to our collaboration.

Best regards,
