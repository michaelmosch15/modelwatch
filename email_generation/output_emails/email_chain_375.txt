Hi Heather,

I hope this message finds you well. I’m reaching out to discuss a potential collaboration between our departments that could align with Merck’s strategic goals on sustainability and employee engagement.

As you know, our team has been working on the “Green Merck Initiative,” aimed at expanding our woodland restoration projects across the company’s campuses. We’re looking at ways to integrate this project with our employees’ pension schemes, specifically by offering green investment options or incentives tied to sustainable practices.

Given your expertise in managing our pension schemes, I believe you could provide valuable insights into how we can structure these options effectively. Perhaps we could set up a meeting next week to brainstorm ideas? I’m available on Thursday and Friday, and I can adjust my schedule to fit yours.

Looking forward to your thoughts.

Best,

Hi Alec,

Thanks for reaching out! I’m excited about the possibilities you mentioned. Integrating green investment options into our pension schemes is definitely something I’ve been keen to explore, as it aligns perfectly with our commitment to sustainable business practices.

I’m available for a meeting on Thursday at 3 PM. We could meet in my office (Room 204, Building B) or via Zoom if that's more convenient for you. I’ll prepare some initial thoughts on how we can leverage existing frameworks to promote sustainable investments to our employees.

Also, as a heads up, I’ll be on leave the following week starting October 16th, so it would be great to get the ball rolling before then.

Let me know if Thursday works for you, or if you have another preference.

Best regards,
