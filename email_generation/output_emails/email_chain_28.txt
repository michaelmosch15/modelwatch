Hi Richard,

I hope this email finds you well. I’m reaching out to discuss a potential collaboration on an educational outreach program that Merck is planning to launch early next year. Given your expertise as a Special Educational Needs Teacher, I believe your insights would be invaluable in shaping the curriculum for our initiative.

The program aims to increase awareness and understanding of pharmaceutical developments, particularly in the area of vaccines. We’re looking to tailor the content to be accessible and engaging for students with special educational needs.

Could we schedule a meeting to explore this further? I’m available for a call or in-person meeting at the Rahway office next week, if that suits you. Let me know your available times.

Looking forward to your insights.

Best regards,

Hi Vernon,

Thank you for reaching out. This sounds like a fantastic initiative, and I’d be thrilled to contribute. I agree that making the content accessible is crucial, and I can certainly assist in adapting the material to suit diverse learning needs.

Next week works for me, though I’ll be out of the office on Friday for a personal commitment. How does Wednesday at 10 AM sound for a meeting at the Rahway office? Alternatively, I’m open to a virtual call if that’s more convenient.

Looking forward to collaborating on this project.

Warm regards,
