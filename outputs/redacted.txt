Project Name: North Tennis Courts Remed[REDACTED] Project

Project Timeline: Monday, November 17,[REDACTED], through April 2026

What work is being done? 

The Construction Manager for the project, J.R. Pr[REDACTED], will begin mobilization and site preparation activities, including, but not limited to, construction[REDACTED] installation, site preparation,[REDACTED] work, and mis[REDACTED][REDACTED] within the[REDACTED] Point[REDACTED] ([REDACTED]H) lower parking lot area, as part of the North Tennis Courts Remed[REDACTED] project. These activities are part of the pre-[REDACTED][REDACTED] efforts that take place before the commencement of construction. The upgrades will consist of court expansion,[REDACTED]-[REDACTED][REDACTED] entrances and seating, an LED[REDACTED], a new stormwater management system, and improvements to the adjacent CPH parking lot. The latest tennis courts will meet I[REDACTED]/ITF standards recognized by the NCAA and US[REDACTED].

When will the work occur?

The work is anticipated to begin the week of November 17th. All activities will occur Monday through Friday from 8:00 AM to 6:00 PM (per Hob[REDACTED][REDACTED]).

Why is this work happening? 

These improvements provide an enhanced tennis facility that supports NCAA-level competition for our student-[REDACTED][REDACTED] and can be used by both the Stevens Community and Hob[REDACTED] residents.

How will this work impact the Stevens Community?

The lower CPH parking lot will be fully closed, along with a portion of the upper lot near the existing tennis trailer.[REDACTED] vehicles will remain in the upper CPH lot. Construction activities will be contained within a f[REDACTED] area, and building entrances/[REDACTED]ways around CPH will remain accessible. Soil erosion and dust mitigation measures will also be implemented for the duration of the construction. Expect typical construction noise at times; impacts will be minimal and vary depending on the activity. Large deliveries may require brief, temporary closures and will be coordinated in advance. 

Who will be performing the work? 

J.R. Pr[REDACTED] and their[REDACTED]ors will conduct the work under the[REDACTED] of the Department of Design and Construction. They will work diligently to ensure the job is completed efficiently and safely. 

To whom should I direct questions?
