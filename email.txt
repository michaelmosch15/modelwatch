The light rail has been delayed. I’ll likely be a little late, sorry!

Thanks Mike!
Next Friday the 14th is perfect - I’ll send out an invite shortly for 12:30-1:30. I’m also
inviting two other SGA members who help out with our civic engagement work.
Looking forward to chatting!

Hey Mike,
I hope you are having a great week! To make the connection from last night on the SGA Board
of Advisors call, my name is Michael Moschello and I am the VP of Relations for the SGA.
I appreciate you taking the time to serve as an SGA advisor. Since you’re local, I was
wondering if you’d be available for a Pi-Kitchen lunch on campus sometime in the next few
weeks. I would love to learn more about your work with local government and how I can help
foster a better relationship between the student body and the Hoboken community.
Let me know what dates/times work best - Pi Kitchen is open from11:30-3pm on weekdays.
Thank you again and I am looking forward to chatting!
Kind regards,
Michael Moschello
